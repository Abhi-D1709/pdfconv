Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under
current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair values have been derived,
financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques.

The fair value of the CCCPS is measured using the Monte Carlo Simulation technique. The Monte Carlo Simulation Method is one where a risk-neutral framework is used to simulate a range of
simulated values, representing all the potential paths a variable could move over the period of the simulation. The inputs to this model are taken from observable market where possible, but where
this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is exercised in establishing fair values. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. 
The equity instruments which are actively traded on public stock exchanges with readily available active prices on a regular basis are classified as Level 1. Units held in mutual funds are
measured based on their published net asset value (NAV), taking into account redemption and/or other restrictions are generally Level 1. Equity instruments in non-listed entities are initially
recognised at transaction price and re-measured as per fair valuation report and valued as at the measurement date or at the nearest available date has been classified as Level 2.
For investment at fair value through profit and loss, valuation are done using quoted prices from active markets or on published Net Asset Values of the investment at the measurement date or at
the nearest available date. 
This level of hierarchy includes financial liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using
a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data, this
level of hierarchy includes cumulative compulsory convertible preference shares.

42 Segment Reporting
The fair values of loans and receivables are estimated by discounted cash flow models that incorporate assumptions for credit risks, probability of default and loss given default estimates. Since comparable data is not
available, credit risk is derived using historical experience, management view and other information used in its collective impairment models.
Fair values of portfolios are calculated using a portfolio-based approach, grouping loans as far as possible into homogenous groups based on similar characteristics ie, type of loan. The Company then calculates and
extrapolates the fair value to the entire portfolio using Effective interest rate model that incorporate interest rate estimates considering all significant characteristics of the loans. The credit risk is applied as a top-side
adjustment based on the collective impairment model incorporating probability of defaults and loss given defaults. Hence, the carrying amount of such financial assets at amortised cost net of impairment loss allowance
is of reasonable approximation of their fair value.
The fair values of financial liability held-to-maturity are estimated using a effective interest rate model based on contractual cash flows using actual yields. Since the cost of borrowing on the reporting date is not
expected to be significantly different from the actual yield considered under effective interest rate model, the carrying value of financial liabilities at amortised cost is considered a reasonable approximation of their fair
value.
In accordance with Para 4 of IND AS 108, Operating Segments, segment information has been presented in the consolidated financial statements of Muthoot FinCorp Limited and therefore, no separate disclosure has
been given in standalone financial statement. 
Set out below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the financial statements. This table does not include the fair

For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts, which are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Such
instruments include: cash and balances, Trade receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents and trade payables without a specific maturity. Such amounts have been classified as Level 3 on the basis that no
adjustments have been made to the balances in the balance sheet.

The Company addresses credit risk through following major processes:
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include
loans, investments, cash and cash equivalents and other receivables that derive directly from its operations. 
As a financial lending institution, Company is exposed to various risks that are related to lending business and operating environment. The principal objective in Company 's risk management processes is to measure and monitor the various risks that
Company is subject to and to follow policies and procedures to address such risks. 
The Company's Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors constituted in accordance with the RBI rules has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Risk Management Policy. The committee meets quarterly to
review the Risk Management practices and working of the Risk Management Department. The committee is chaired by an Independent Director. The Risk Management department periodically places its report to the committee for review. The
committee’s suggestions for improving the Risk Management Practices are implemented by the Risk Management department.  
The Company has implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to assess, monitor and manage risk throughout the Group. The risk management process is continuously reviewed, improved and adapted in the changing risk scenario and the
agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the changing risk landscape. The process of continuous evaluation of risks includes taking stock of the risk landscape on an event-driven basis. The Company
has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically addressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis.
The major type of risk Company faces in business are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk.
Credit Risk arises from the risk of loss that may occur from the default of Company's customers under loan agreements. Customer defaults and inadequate collateral may lead to higher NPAs.
- Standardize the process of identifying new risks and designing appropriate controls for these risks
- Minimize losses due to defaults or untimely payments by borrowers
- Maintain an appropriate credit administration and loan review system 
- Establish metrics for portfolio appraisal and monitoring
- Design appropriate credit risk mitigation techniques
The Company’s impairment assessment and measurement approach is set out in this note. It should be read in conjunction with the Summary of significant accounting policies.
The Company considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.
As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Company also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such events occur, the Company carefully considers whether the event should result
in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate.
It is the Company’s policy to consider a financial instrument as ‘cured’ and therefore re-classified out of Stage 3 when none of the default criteria have been present for at least three consecutive months. The decision whether to classify an asset as
Stage 2 or Stage 1 once cured depends on the updated credit grade, at the time of the cure, and whether this indicates there has been a significant increase in credit risk compared to initial recognition. 
Company's internal credit rating grades and staging criteria for  loans are as follows:

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company may not meet its financial obligations. Liquidity risk arises due to the unavailability of adequate funds at an appropriate cost or tenure. The objective of liquidity risk management, is to maintain
sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Company consistently generates sufficient cash flows from operating and financial activities to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. Our
resource mobilisation team sources funds from multiple sources, including from banks, financial institutions, capital & retail markets to maintain a healthy mix of sources. The resource mobilisation team is responsible for diversifying fund raising
sources, managing interest rate risks and maintaining a strong relationship with banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies, other domestic and foreign financial institutions and rating agencies to ensure the liquidity risk is well
addressed.
The outstanding balance as at the reporting date is considered as EAD by the company.
The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. To calculate the ECL for a Stage 1 loan, the Company assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the calculation of the 12mECL. For Stage
2 and Stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the instruments. The Company uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products, schemes, ticket size,
loan to value and geographies, the Company has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach considering fresh slippage using historical information. 
The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Company expects to receive. LGD Rates for Gold
Loans have been computed internally based on the discounted recoveries in NPA accounts that are closed/ written off/ repossessed and upgraded during the year. For other loans, LGD rates have been arrived at guided by the Foundational Internal
Ratings Based approach (FIRB) norms.
When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Company applies the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
Significant Increase in credit risk
The internal rating model evaluates the loans on an ongoing basis. The rating model also assesses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the previously assigned risk grade. One key factor that indicates significant increase in credit
risk is when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.
The table below shows the maturity pattern of the assets and liabilities:

Prepayment risk
Operational and business risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Company will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment earlier or later than expected.
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to operate effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial 
loss. The Company cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but it endeavours to manage these risks through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access, 
authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, such as the use of internal audit.
Market Risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market factor. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the interest rates and other
market changes. The Company is exposed to two types of market risk as follows:
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is subject to interest rate risk, principally because we lend to clients at fixed interest rates and for
periods that may differ from our funding sources, while our borrowings are at both fixed and variable interest rates for different periods. We assess and manage our interest rate risk by managing our assets and liabilities. Our Asset Liability
Management Committee evaluates asset liability management, and ensures that all significant mismatches, if any, are being managed appropriately.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion of  borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the profit before taxes affected through the impact on floating rate 
borrowings is as follows:
Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decreases as the result of changes in level of equity indices and individual stocks.  The trading and non-trading equity price risk  exposure arises from equity securities classified at FVOCI”. A 
10% increase/(decrease) in the equity price (traded and non-traded) would have the impact as follows:

The after effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant restrictions have continued to have its impact on economic activity during the year ended March 31, 2022. However, this has not
resulted in a significant impact on the operations / financial position of the Company, though there has been an expected level of stress in collections and higher gold auctions during the year.
With reduced probability of restrictions even in times of Covid spikes thereby allowing continuity of general economic momentum, the future performances and collections are expected to
improve. 
In the opinion of the management, the impairment loss allowance as stated in Note 8 is considered adequate to cover any future uncertainties on account of the above.

(b) IT Systems and Controls
The Company's key financial accounting 
and reporting processes are highly 
dependent on the automated controls in 
information systems. We have considered 
this as Key Audit Matter as any control 
lapses, incorrect input data and wrong 
extraction of data may result in the 
financial accounting and reporting records 
being misstated.

Information other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report thereon 
The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the 
financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Annual Report is expected to be 
made available to us after the date of this auditor's report. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other

other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, 
we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Ind AS 
Financial Statements 
The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the 
Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these Ind AS Financial Statements that 
give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, changes in equity and 
cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act. This 
responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with 
the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and 
detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the 
Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors 
either intends·to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so. 
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the company's financial reporting 
process. 
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the
Companies Act, 2013, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the
company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating
effectiveness of such controls.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including
the disclosures, and whether the Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial statements that, individually or 
in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and 
qualitative factors in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our 
work; and to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements. 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope_ and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards. 
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

Annexure B to Independent Auditors' Report 
Referred to in paragraph 2(f) under 'Report on other legal and regulatory requirements' 
of the Independent Auditors' Report of even date to the members of Muthoot FinCorp 
Limited on the Ind AS Financial Statements as of and for the year ended 31 March 2 021 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 
of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act"): 
Opinion 
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Muthoot FinCorp 
Limited ("the Company") as of March 31, 2021 in conjunction with our audit of the Ind AS 
Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. 
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial 
reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2021, based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditors' Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over 
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance 
Note") and the Standards on Auditing, both issued by the ICAI and deemed to be prescribed 
under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established 
and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. 
F 486


# Page 669
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of 
the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system over financial 
reporting. 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those 
policies and procedures that; (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements. 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.

Basis of measurement 
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for following assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value: 
i)
Investments in equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or at fair value through statement of profit or loss (FVTPL)
ii)
Investments which are held for trading
iii)
Defined benefit plans.
Functional and presentation currency 
The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR) which is also functional currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company 
operates. All values are rounded to the nearest lakhs, except when otherwise indicated.  
3. Significant accounting policies
3.1 
Recognition of interest income 
Interest income is recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial assets other than credit-impaired assets and financial assets classified as 
measured at FVTPL. 
 The EIR in case of a financial asset is computed: 
a.
As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset.
b.
By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.
c.
Including all fees received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.
 Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets. 
Interest income on credit impaired assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the net amortised cost (net of provision) of the financial asset. 
3.2   Recognition of revenue from sale of goods and services 
Revenue (other than for financial instruments) is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers outlines a single 
comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance found within Ind ASs. 
The Company recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in Ind 115: 
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every 
contract that must be met. 
Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. 
F 493


# Page 676
Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services 
to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. 
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to 
each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. 
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation 
Revenue from contract with customer for rendering services is recognised at a point in time when performance obligation is satisfied. 
3.2.1 
Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and 
the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably. 
3.2.2 
Rental Income 
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss, unless the increase 
is in line with expected general inflation, in which case lease income is recognised based on contractual terms. 
3.2.3 
Fees and commission income 
Fees and commission income such as service charges, commission from fee based business lines, service income etc. are recognised on point in time basis. 
3.2.4 
Net gain on fair value changes 
The Company designates certain financial assets for subsequent measurement at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The 
Company recognises gains on fair value change of financial assets measured at FVTPL on net basis. 
3.2.5 
Net gain on derecognition of financial instruments 
Gains arising out of direct assignment transactions comprise the difference between the interest on the loan portfolio and the applicable rate at which the direct assignment is entered into with 
the assignee, also known as the excess interest spread (EIS).  
3.3 Financial instruments 
1.1.1. Initial recognition 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition 
of the financial asset. 
Loans are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account. Investments are recognised on settlement date. The Company recognises debt securities and borrowings when funds 
reach the Company, post allotment if applicable. 
F 494


# Page 677
1.1.2. Initial and subsequent measurement of financial instruments 
The Company classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: 
1.
Debt instruments at amortised cost
2.
Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
3.
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
4.
Equity instruments in subsidiary companies at cost
5.
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI
The classification depends on the contractual terms of the financial assets’ cash flows and the Company’s business model for managing financial assets which are explained below: 
Business model assessment 
The Company determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective. 
The Company's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as: 
► How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity's key management personnel
► The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and the way those risks are managed
► How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected)
► The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Company’s assessment. The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without
taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Company's original expectations, the Company
does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased
financial assets going forward.
The SPPI test 
As a second step of its classification process, the Company assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. 
 ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments 
of principal or amortisation of the premium/discount). 
In making this assessment, the Company considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value 
of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are 
inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
F 495


# Page 678
The Company classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through the profit and loss account or is required to measure liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss such as derivative liabilities. 
1.1.3. Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement at fair value plus directly attributable costs, these financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised 
cost is calculated by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in interest income in the profit or 
loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in statement of profit and loss. 
1.1.4. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and selling the assets and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding
Debt instruments included within the FVOCI category are measured at each reporting date at fair value with such changes being recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI). The interest 
income on these assets is recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses or reversals, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Upon disposal, the 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement.  
1.1.5. Financial Instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments that meet the amortised cost 
criteria or the FVTOCI criteria but are designated as at FVTPL are measured at FVTPL. 
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVOCI criteria may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition, if such designation eliminates 
or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases. 
Company’s investment is classified as FVTPL, if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial 
instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of short-term profit taking. 
Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value, with transaction costs recognised in the income statement as incurred. Subsequently, they are 
measured at fair value and any gains or losses are recognised in the income statement as they arise.  
F 496


# Page 679
1.1.6. Equity instruments 
The Company subsequently measures investment in equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, unless the Company’s management has elected to classify irrevocably some of its 
equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI, when such instruments meet the definition of definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for 
trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Gains and losses on these equity instruments classified at FVOCI are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised in profit or loss as dividend income when the right of the payment 
has been established, except when the Company benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI.  
3.3.1  Financial Liabilities 
Initial Measurement 
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition or the issue of financial liability, which are not at fair value through 
profit or loss, are adjusted to fair value at initial recognition. 
Subsequent Measurement  
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
3.4 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
3.4.1 Financial Asset 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from 
the financial asset have expired. The Company also derecognises the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.  
The Company has transferred the financial asset if, and only if, either: 
a)
The Company has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset
or
b)
It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass–
through’ arrangement
Pass-through arrangements are transactions whereby the Company retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of a financial asset (the 'original asset'), but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more entities (the 'eventual recipients'), when all of the following three conditions are met: 
► The Company has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it has collected equivalent amounts from the original asset, excluding short-term
advances with the right to full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued interest at market rates
F 497


# Page 680
► The Company cannot sell or pledge the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients
► The Company has to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay. In addition, the Company is not entitled to reinvest such
cash flows, except for investments in cash or cash equivalents including interest earned, during the period between the collection date and the date of required remittance
to the eventual recipients.
A transfer only qualifies for derecognition if either: 
► The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or,
► The Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset
► The Company considers control to be transferred if and only if, the transferee has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is
able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without imposing additional restrictions on the transfer.
When the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and has retained control of the asset, the asset continues to be recognised 
only to the extent of the Company’s continuing involvement, in which case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained. 
3.4.2 Financial Liability 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender 
on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as de recognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. 
3.5 Offsetting 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when the 
Company has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously in all the following circumstances: 
a.
The normal course of business
b.
The event of default
c.
The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company and/or its counter parties.
3.6 Impairment of financial assets 
3.6.1 
Overview of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) principles 
The Company has created provisions on all financial assets wherever required, except for financial assets classified as FVTPL, based on the expected credit loss method. 
F 498


# Page 681
The ECL provision is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since 
origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss. The 12-month ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs that result from default 
events on financial assets that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. 
The Company performs an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the 
change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. 
Based on the above process, the Company categorises its loans into three stages as described below: 
For non-impaired financial instruments 

Stage 1 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have not experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. A 12-month ECL provision
is made for stage 1 financial instruments. In assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument
as at the reporting date, with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition.

Stage 2 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have experienced a SICR since initial recognition. The Company recognises lifetime ECL for stage 2 financial
instruments. In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit risk of the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a SICR since initial recognition, then entities recognize
12 months of ECL.
For impaired financial instruments: 
Financial instruments are classified as stage 3 when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more loss events that have occurred after initial recognition with a negative 
impact on the estimated future cash flows of a loan or a portfolio of loans. The Company recognises lifetime ECL for impaired financial instruments. 
3.6.2 
The calculation of ECLs 
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows: 
Probability of Default (PD) - The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. 
The Company uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products, schemes, ticket size, loan to value and geographies, the Company has bifurcated 
its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach considering fresh slippage using historical information.  
Exposure at Default (EAD) - The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including 
repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.  
Loss Given Default (LGD) – The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual 
cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive.  
Forward looking information 
While estimating the expected credit losses, the Company reviews macro-economic developments occurring in the economy and market it operates in. On a periodic basis, the Company analyses 
if there is any relationship between key economic trends like GDP, unemployment rates, benchmark rates set by the Reserve Bank of India, inﬂation etc. with the estimate of PD, LGD determined 
F 499


# Page 682
by the Company based on its internal data. While the internal estimates of PD, LGD rates by the Company may not be always reﬂective of such relationships, temporary overlays, if any, are 
embedded in the methodology to reﬂect such macro-economic trends reasonably. 
Write-offs 
Loans are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when it is determined that the customer does not have assets or sources 
of income that could generate sufﬁcient cash ﬂows to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are credited to the statement of proﬁt and loss. 
Collateral 
To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Company seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in various forms, such as gold,  securities, letters of credit/guarantees, 
stock, current asset etc. However, the fair value of collateral affects the calculation of ECLs. The fair value of the same is based on data provided by third party or management judgements. 
Impairment of Trade receivables 
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance 
on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables. 
3.7 Determination of fair value 
The Company measures financial instruments, such as, investments at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement 
is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
i.
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
ii.
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, if market participants act in their economic best 
interest. 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. 
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which enough data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
The financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as summarised below: 
Level 1 financial instruments − Those where the inputs used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has access to at 
the measurement date. The Company considers markets as active only if there are sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical assets or liabilities and 
when there are binding and exercisable price quotes available on the balance sheet date. 
Level 2 financial instruments − Those where the inputs that are used for valuation and are significant, are derived from directly or indirectly observable market data available over the entire 
period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets and observable inputs 
F 500


# Page 683
other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit spreads. In addition, adjustments may be required for the condition or location of the asset or the 
extent to which it relates to items that are comparable to the valued instrument. However, if such adjustments are based on unobservable inputs which are significant to the entire measurement, 
the Company will classify the instruments as Level 3. 
Level 3 financial instruments − Those that include one or more unobservable input that is signiﬁcant to the measurement as whole. 
3.8 Foreign Currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the spot rate of ex-change ruling at the date of the transaction. However, for practical reasons, the Company 
uses an average rate if the average approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. All differences arising on non–
trading activities are taken to other income/expense in the statement of profit and loss.  
Non–monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rates as at the date of recognition. 
3.9 Finance cost 
Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial liabilities other than financial liabilities classified as 
FVTPL. 
Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognized as part of the carrying value of the financial liability and amortized over the expected life using the effective interest method. 
These include fees and commissions payable to advisers and other expenses such as external legal costs, provided these are incremental costs that are directly related to the issue of a financial 
liability. Interest accrued on lease liability recognized and measured in accordance with Ind AS 116 “Leases” also forms part of Finance cost. 
3.10 Other income and expenses  
All Other income and expense are recognized in the period they occur. 
3.11  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand, short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less and forex balances, which are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short- term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts, if any, as they are 
considered an integral part of the Company’s cash management. 
3.12   Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, (if any). The total cost of assets comprises its purchase price, freight, 
duties, taxes and any other incidental expenses directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the 
management.  
Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
F 501


# Page 684
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible asset are added to its gross value only if it increases the future benefits of the existing asset, beyond its previously assessed standards of 
performance and cost can be measured reliably. Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed off as and when incurred. 
3.12.1 
Depreciation 
Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended 
use.  
Depreciation is charged based on a review by the management during the year and at the rates derived based on the useful lives of the assets as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 
2013 on Straight Line Method.   
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Particulars 
Useful life 
Buildings 
60 years 
Computer 
3 years 
Furniture and Fixtures 
5 to 30 years 
Plant and Equipment 
5 to 20 years 
Vehicles 
5 to 8 years 
Windmill 
22 years 
Office equipment 
15 years 
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
Property plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the year the asset is derecognised. The date of disposal of 
an item of property, plant and equipment is the date the recipient obtains control of that item in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in 
Ind AS 115. 
3.13    Intangible assets 
The Company’s intangible assets consist of computer software. 
An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the Company.

# Page 685
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure on making 
the asset ready for its intended use and net of any trade discounts and rebates. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised using the Written down value method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets 
comprising of software are amortised on a Written down value basis over a period of 3 years keeping residual value 5%. 
Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. 
3.14   Investment Property 
Properties, held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation are classified as investment property and measured and reported at cost, including transaction costs, borrowing cost and other directly 
attributable cost in bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that the future 
economic benefit associated with the expenditure will flow to the company. 
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any 
gain or loss arising on derecognition of property is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the same period. 
The fair value of investment property is disclosed in the notes accompanying these financial statements. Fair value has been determined by an independent valuer who holds a recognised and 
relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued. 
3.15 Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Company’s assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, 
the Company estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in 
use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When 
the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are considered. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation 
model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, 
the Company estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit 
or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

3.16 Post-employment benefits 
3.16.1 Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to the Employees Provident Fund Scheme maintained by the Central Government, Employee State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) etc. are accounted for on an accrual basis. 
Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined contribution scheme.  
The company has no obligation, other than the contribution payable under the schemes. The company recognizes contribution payable to the provident fund scheme / ESIC as expenditure, when 
an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme / ESIC for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit 
payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the 
balance sheet date, then excess is recognized as an asset. 
3.16.2 
Defined Benefit schemes 
Gratuity 
The Company provides for gratuity covering eligible employees under which a lumpsum payment is paid to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, 
of an amount reckoned on the respective employee’s salary and his tenor of employment with the Company. The Company accounts for its liability for future gratuity benefits based on actuarial 
valuation determined at each Balance Sheet date by an Independent Actuary using Projected Unit Credit Method. The Company makes contributions to a Gratuity Fund administered by the Life 
Insurance Corporation of India.  
The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan are based 
on the market yields on Government Securities as at the Balance Sheet date.     
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases 
and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed 
at each reporting date. 
Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability), are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with 
a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassiﬁed to proﬁt and loss in subsequent periods. 
3.17 Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the enterprise determines the level of provision by discounting the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific 
to the liability. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. 
3.18  Taxes 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
F 504


# Page 687
3.18.1 Current Tax 
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of taxable profit for a period. Taxable profit differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss because 
of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws.  
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of reporting date in India where the Company operates and generates 
taxable income. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
3.18.2 Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income tax is determined 
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is probable that future taxable amounts will arise to utilise those temporary 
differences and losses. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit and loss is recognised either in other comprehensive income or in equity. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on 
the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities are realised simultaneously. 
3.18.3 Goods and services tax /value added taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses 
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the goods and services tax/value added taxes paid, except: 
i.
When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the
asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable
ii. When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included
The net amount of tax recoverable from and / or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables respectively in the balance sheet. 
3.19 Contingent Liabilities and assets 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond 
the control of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also 
arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its 
existence in the ﬁnancial statements. 
F 505


# Page 688
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be conﬁrmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not 
wholly within the control of the entity. The company does not have any contingent assets in the ﬁnancial statements. 
3.20 Earnings Per Share 
The Company reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable 
to equity shareholders (after deducting preference dividend and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted 
for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have been issued at a later date. In 
computing the dilutive earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that either reduces the earnings per share or increases loss per share are included. 
3.21 Dividends on ordinary shares 
The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders of the Company when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion 
of the Company. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. 
Non-cash distributions are measured at the fair value of the assets to be distributed with fair value re-measurement recognised directly in equity. 
Upon distribution of non-cash assets, any difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the carrying amount of the assets distributed is recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss. 
3.22 Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement 
is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
Transition to Ind AS 116 
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) through Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2019 and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Second Amendment 
Rules, had notified Ind AS 116 Leases which replaces the existing lease standard, Ind AS 17 Leases, and other interpretations. Ind AS 116 sets out the principles for recognition, measurement, 
presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. It introduces single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for leases. 
The Company had adopted Ind AS 116, effective annual reporting period beginning April 1, 2019, using modified retrospective approach and accordingly previous period information has not 
been reinstated.  
Company as a lessee 
The Company’s lease asset class consist of building, equipment and vehicles. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a 
lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company has, at the date of transition, recognized a right-of 
use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short term lease) and low value assets. For 
these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.  
F 506


# Page 689
The right-of-use assets are recognized at cost, which comprises the present value of the lease liability as at the date of transition. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the balance lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease 
payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit on the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates. Interest accrued on lease liability and lease payments 
made, are subsequently adjusted to the initial recognition of lease liability. 
On application of Ind AS 116, the nature of expenses has changed from lease rent in previous periods to depreciation cost for the right-to-use asset, and finance cost for interest accrued on lease 
liability. For leases that were classified as finance lease applying Ind AS 17, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of transition to Ind AS 116 is the 
carrying amount of the lease asset and the lease liability on the transition date as measured applying Ind AS 17. 
Company as a lessor 
Leases where the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased items are operating leases. Rental Income arising from operating leases 
is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss.  
3.23 Cash flow statement 
Cash flows are reported using indirect method, whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash 
receipts or payments and items of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from regular revenue generating (operating activities), investing and 
financing activities of the Company are segregated. 
4 
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the 
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. 
In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognized 
in the ﬁnancial statements is included in the following notes: 
4.1 
Business Model Assessment 
Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The Company determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups 
of financial assets are managed together to achieve a business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the performance of the assets is 
evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Company 
monitors financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity to understand the reason for their disposal 
and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for which the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Company’s continuous assessment of whether the business model 
for which the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the 
classification of those assets. 
F 507


# Page 690
4.2 
Deﬁned employee beneﬁt assets and liabilities 
The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions 
that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the 
valuation and its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
4.3 
Fair value measurement: 
When the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using 
various valuation techniques. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair 
values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of ﬁnancial 
instruments. 
4.4 
Impairment of financial assets 
The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when 
determining impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by several factors, changes in which can result in different levels of allowances. 
It has been the Company’s policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience, regulatory advisories, market conditions and forecasts and revise when necessary.  
4.5 
Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method 
The Company’s EIR methodology, recognises interest income / expense using a rate of return that represents the best estimate of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of 
loans given / taken and recognises the effect of potentially different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments and penalty interest 
and charges). 
This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and life-cycle of the instruments, as well expected changes to India’s base rate and other fee 
income/expense that are integral parts of the instrument. 
4.6 
Other estimates: 
These include contingent liabilities, useful lives of tangible and intangible assets etc.

The Company has sold some loans and advances measured at amortised cost, as a source of finance. As per terms of the deal, risk and reward has been transferred to the customer. Hence, as per the derecognition criteria of IND AS
109, including transfer of substantially all risks and rewards relating to assets being transferred to the buyer being met, the assets have been derecognised. The table below summarises the carrying amount of the derecognised
financial assets:
The Company had used securitisation as a source of finance by way of securitising its gold loans to different entities. These entities were not related to the Company. Also, the Company neither held any equity nor other interest nor
control in them. 
As per the terms of the agreement, the Company was exposed to first loss ranging to 5%-7% of the amount securitised and therefore continued to be exposed to significant risk and rewards relating to the underlying loans. These
receivables were not derecognised and proceeds received were recorded as a financial liability under borrowings.
The table below outlines the carrying amounts and fair values of all financial assets transferred that were not derecognised in their entirety and associated liabilities.
Nature and Purpose
To generate 
 - funding for the Company's
lending activities
 - Spread through sale of
assets to investors
 - Fees for servicing loan
 - Servicing fee
 - Credit Enhancement provided by the
Company
 - Excess interest spread

14.1. The Company operates its branch network predominantly through premises taken on lease at strategic locations identified by the management. Majority of the lease arrangements are long term in
nature and are non-cancellable from the point of view of the lessor, except for a few lease contracts. Other than such leasehold property, the Company has also undertaken lease arrangements for Safety
Device Equipments and Vehicles, whose original lease tenures too are not short-term in nature. Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted Ind AS 116 “Leases” and applied the standard to all lease
contracts existing on April 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method. Consequently, the Company recorded the lease liability at the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted at the
incremental borrowing rate as on the date of transition and has measured right of use asset at an amount equal to lease liability adjusted for any accrued lease payments previously recognised.
14.2. The expense relating to payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability is as follows:

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under
current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair values have been derived,
financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques.

42 Segment Reporting
The equity instruments which are actively traded on public stock exchanges with readily available active prices on a regular basis are classified as Level 1. Units held in mutual funds are measured based on their
published net asset value (NAV), taking into account redemption and/or other restrictions are generally Level 1. Equity instruments in non-listed entities are initially recognised at transaction price and re-measured as per
fair valuation report and valued on a case-by-case has been classified as Level 2.
For investment at fair value through profit and loss, valuation are done using quoted prices from active markets or on published Net Asset Values of the investment at the measurement date. 
Set out below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the financial statements. This table does not include the fair
values of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.
Particulars
Level
Carrying Value
Fair Value
For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts, which are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Such
instruments include: cash and balances, Trade receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents and trade payables without a specific maturity. Such amounts have been classified as Level 3 on the basis that no
adjustments have been made to the balances in the balance sheet.
The fair values of loans and receivables are estimated by discounted cash flow models that incorporate assumptions for credit risks, probability of default and loss given default estimates. Since comparable data is not
available, hence Credit risk is derived using, historical experience, management view and other information used in its collective impairment models.
Fair values of portfolios are calculated using a portfolio-based approach, grouping loans as far as possible into homogenous groups based on similar characteristics ie, type of loan. The Company then calculates and
extrapolates the fair value to the entire portfolio using Effective interest rate model that incorporate interest rate estimates considering all significant characteristics of the loans. The credit risk is applied as a top-side
adjustment based on the collective impairment model incorporating probability of defaults and loss given defaults.
The fair values of financial liability held-to-maturity are estimated using a effective interest rate  model based on contractual cash flows using actual yields. 
In accordance with Para 4 of IND AS 108, Operating Segments, segment information has been presented in the consolidated financial statements of Muthoot FinCorp Limited and therefore, no separate disclosure has
been given in standalone financial statement.

The Company addresses credit risk through following major processes:
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include
loans, investments, cash and cash equivalents and other receivables that derive directly from its operations. 
As a financial lending institution, Company is exposed to various risks that are related to lending business and operating environment. The principal objective in Company 's risk management processes is to measure and monitor the various risks that
Company is subject to and to follow policies and procedures to address such risks. 
The Company's Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors constituted in accordance with the RBI rules has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Risk Management Policy. The committee meets quarterly to
review the Risk Management practices and working of the Risk Management Department. The committee is chaired by an Independent Director. Risk Management department periodically places its report to the committee for review. The
committee’s suggestions for improving the Risk Management Practices are implemented by the Risk Management department.  
The Company has implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to assess, monitor and manage risk throughout the Group. The risk management process is continuously reviewed, improved and adapted in the changing risk scenario and the
agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the changing risk landscape. The process of continuous evaluation of risks includes taking stock of the risk landscape on an event-driven basis. The Company
has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically addressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis.
The major type of risk Company faces in business are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk.
Credit Risk arises from the risk of loss that may occur from the default of Company's customers under loan agreements. Customer defaults and inadequate collateral may lead to higher NPAs.
- Standardize the process of identifying new risks and designing appropriate controls for these risks
- Minimize losses due to defaults or untimely payments by borrowers
- Maintain an appropriate credit administration and loan review system 
- Establish metrics for portfolio appraisal and monitoring
- Design appropriate credit risk mitigation techniques
The Company’s impairment assessment and measurement approach is set out in this note. It should be read in conjunction with the Summary of significant accounting policies.
The Company considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.
As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Company also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such events occur, the Company carefully considers whether the event should result
in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate.
It is the Company’s policy to consider a financial instrument as ‘cured’ and therefore re-classified out of Stage 3 when none of the default criteria have been present for at least three consecutive months. The decision whether to classify an asset as
Stage 2 or Stage 1 once cured depends on the updated credit grade, at the time of the cure, and whether this indicates there has been a significant increase in credit risk compared to initial recognition. 
Company's internal credit rating grades and staging criteria for  loans are as follows:

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company may not meet its financial obligations. Liquidity risk arises due to the unavailability of adequate funds at an appropriate cost or tenure. The objective of liquidity risk management, is to maintain
sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Company consistently generates sufficient cash flows from operating and financial activities to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. Our
resource mobilisation team sources funds from multiple sources, including from banks, financial institutions, capital & retail markets to maintain a healthy mix of sources. The resource mobilisation team is responsible for diversifying fund raising
sources, managing interest rate risks and maintaining a strong relationship with banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies, other domestic and foreign financial institutions and rating agencies to ensure the liquidity risk is well
addressed.
The outstanding balance as at the reporting date is considered as EAD by the company.
The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. To calculate the ECL for a Stage 1 loan, the Company assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the calculation of the 12mECL. For Stage
2 and Stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the instruments. The Company uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products, schemes, ticket size,
loan to value and geographies, the Company has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach considering fresh slippage using historical information. 
The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Company expects to receive. LGD Rates for Gold
Loans have been computed internally based on the discounted recoveries in NPA accounts that are closed/ written off/ repossessed and upgraded during the year. For other loans, LGD rates have been arrived at guided by the Foundational Internal
Ratings Based approach (FIRB) norms.
When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Company applies the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
Significant Increase in credit risk
The internal rating model evaluates the loans on an ongoing basis. The rating model also assesses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the previously assigned risk grade. One key factor that indicates significant increase in credit
risk is when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.

Prepayment risk
Operational and business risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Company will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment earlier or later than expected.
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to operate effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial 
loss. The Company cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but it endeavours to manage these risks through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access, 
authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, such as the use of internal audit.
Market Risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market factor. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the interest rates and other 
market changes. The Company is exposed to two types of market risk as follows:
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is  subject to interest rate risk, principally because we lend to clients at fixed interest rates and for 
periods that may differ from our funding sources, while our borrowings are at both fixed and variable interest rates for different periods.  We assess and manage our interest rate risk by managing our assets and liabilities. Our Asset Liability 
Management Committee evaluates asset liability management, and ensures that all significant mismatches, if any, are being managed appropriately.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion of  borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the profit before taxes affected through the impact on floating rate 
borrowings is as follows:
Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decreases as the result of changes in level of equity indices and individual stocks.  The trading and non-trading equity price risk  exposure arises from equity securities classified at FVOCI”. A 
10% increase/(decrease) in the  equity price (traded and non-traded) would have the impact as follows:

The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact and volatility in the global and domestic economies resulting in decrease in economic activities. Increase in
infection rate and lockdowns / movement restrictions announced by the Central Government and various State Governments in lndia and the outbreak of the second wave of the pandemic
may further slowdown the economic activity. However, this has not resulted in a significant impact on the financial position of the Company as at the reporting date.
Pursuant to the relevant Reserve Bank of India circulars allowing lending institutions to offer moratorium to borrowers on payment of instalments falling due between March 1, 2020 and
August 31, 2020, the Company had granted moratorium to its borrowers based on its Board approved policy. For such accounts, where the moratorium was granted, the asset / stage-wise
classification remained stand still during the moratorium period. Pursuant to the judgement of the Honourable Supreme Court dated March 23, 2021, vacating the interim order not to declare
accounts as NPA and the RBI circular thereon, the Company has carried out the asset classification of borrowers as at March 31, 2021 as per the ECL model and the extant RBI instructions /
IRAC norms. Further, in accordance with the relevant circulars on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector – Restructuring of Advances, the Company has restructured a total
of 1,600 MSME accounts, amounting to INR 2,703.11 during the year ended March 31, 2021. The Company continues to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its liquidity and
ability to repay its obligations as and when they fall due and the management believes that the Company will be able to pay its obligations as and when these become due in the foreseeable
future. The Company would continue to focus on maintaining adequate capital and ensuring liquidity at all points in time.

Independent Auditor's Review Report on unaudited standalone financial results of the 
Company pursuant to Regulation 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
To 
The Board of Directors, 
Muthoot Fincorp Limited, 
Muthoot Centre, Punnen Road, 
Thiruvananthapuram - 695 001 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results of
M/s. Muthoot Fincorp Limited, TC No 27/3022, Muthoot Centre, Punnen Road,
Thiruvananthapuram - 695001 ("the Company") for the quarter ended June 30, 2023
("Statement"), being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 52
of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as
amended, read with relevant circulars issued by SEBI.
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by
the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and
measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial
Reporting" (IND AS 34), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as
amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally
accepted in India and in compliance with the Listing Regulations read with relevant circulars
issued by the SEBI. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our
review.
3. We conducted our Review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE)
2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This Standard requires that
we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is
free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel
and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provide less assurance than an
audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to
believe that the accompanying Statement of standalone, unaudited financial results prepared
in accordance with the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards and other accounting principles
generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms
