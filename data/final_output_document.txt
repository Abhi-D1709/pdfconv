the securities shared with Tamil Nadu Mercantile Bank (“TMB”) on pari passu basis. Since the said borrower has 
defaulted in payments, our Company along with TMB has initiated recovery proceedings under the Securitisation and 
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 by issuing a demand notice. 
However, before the possession could be taken, AU Small Finance Bank Ltd initiated insolvency proceedings against 
the Borrower which stood as guarantor and mortgaged some of its properties to a facility granted by the said bank to 
one educational trust in the same group. A Resolution Professional is appointed in the matter and the insolvency 
resolution proceedings are on. The Company and TMB have joined the IBC proceedings along with other lenders. As 
the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (“CIRP”) period ended and the Institutional Financial Creditors voted for 
liquidation of the Borrower i.e., Prabhushanti Real Estate Private. However, the resolution for liquidation was not 
adopted as the home buyers who have a majority voting in the Committee of Creditors cast a negative vote. In the 
meanwhile, the suspended Directors have approached the Delhi bench of the National Company Law Tribunal(‘NCLT 
Delhi') for extension of the CIRP period in view of the announcement of a package by the Central Government for 
revival of the stalled projects in real estate sector. Also, one of the relatives of the suspended directors submitted a draft 
resolution Plan after expiry of the last date fixed for submission of the Resolution Plans and who incidentally did not 
satisfy all the criteria stipulated by the Committee of Creditors (“COC”) for the Resolution applicant. The COC did not 
accept the Resolution Plan, The Resolution applicant has also approached NCLT Delhi for directions to the COC to 
review their decision. The matter is currently pending for disposal.

Resolution Professional filed an application for exclusion of the litigation period from the permissible period of 330 
days as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, in view of the orders of the Supreme Court in the Essar Steel 
matter. The application is dismissed by NCLT with an observation the COC may examine extension of the CIRP period. 
The flat buyers have filed an application in NCLT Delhi seeking to revise their claim amount by including the accrued 
interest on the amounts paid by them.NCLT Delhi.vide order dated April 5, 2023 ordered the substitution of the RP in 
this matter as the registration of the RP was suspended by IBBI. NCLT Delhi further appointed an interim officer on 
special duty for conduct of a special COC meeting for nomination of the new RP. The new RP conducted a further 
COC meeting on May 30, 2023 to examine the Resolution Plan put forth by the flat buyers and to seek extension of 
CIRP period by another 9 days besides seeking exclusion of the litigation period from the CIRP period. Pursuant to the 
COC meeting, the RP filed applications before NCLT Delhi seeking the above reliefs These applications are currently  
pending before the NCLT Delhi.

Professional demanded MFL to handover the possession of the assets taken by MFL under SARFAESI and the same is 
objected by MFL contending that the said assets do not belong to the corporate debtor. NCLT Chennai has since ordered 
liquidation of the said corporate debtor and is yet to dispose of the MA 363/2019 filed by the erstwhile interim resolution 
professional. The Liquidation orders dated December 4, 2019 was challenged in an appeal before NCLAT Delhi.

Civil Proceedings 
 
1. Our Company has on October 22, 2020 filed a writ petition bearing no. W.P. (C) No. 22768/ 2020 before the Hon’ble 
High Court of Kerala against Union of India & others. The Writ Petition has been filed in relation to the directions 
issued by RBI (RBI/2020-21/20 DOR No. BN.BC/7/21/04.048/2020-21) dated August 06, 2020 (“Circular”) which 
directs scheduled commercial banks and payment banks not to open or maintain current accounts for customers who 
have availed credit facilities in the form of cash credit (“CC”)/ overdraft (“OD”) from the banking system and that all 
transactions are required to be routed through the CC/OD account. Our Company has inter alia prayed that RBI should 
issue clarification on implementation and enforcement of the Circular in light of the representations made by our 
Company to RBI and SBI and to SBI to seek clarifications on the points urged in representations made to SBI. Further, 
it has also been prayed that the implementation of Circular, in so far as our Company is concerned, should be kept 
pending the disposal of the Writ Petition. The Hon’ble High Court of Kerala has disposed of the said Writ Petition on 
April 9, 2021 wherein SBI was directed to consider the matter and to arrive at a workable solution in 6 months, failing 
which, SBI was directed to approach RBI. In the meantime, since other banks (where the Company has current 
accounts for its branches) have issued communications to close such accounts in view of the RBI circular and 
since  SBI was  already considering a process for devising an alternate solution to address the issues and such closure 
of accounts would have been detrimental to the interest of the Company, the Company has filed another Writ Petition 
before the Hon’ble High Court bearing W. P (C) No. 14854 / 2021 making all the banks party and seeking for the 
intervention of the court. The Hon’ble court was pleased to order status current account and the next hearing date is 
December 
10, 
2021. 
In 
the 
meantime, 
RBI 
has 
issued 
another 
circular 
RBI/2021-22/116 
DOR.CRE.REC.63/21.04.048/2021-22 dated October 29, 2021 wherein opening of current accounts have been 
permitted with one bank which has more than 10% of banking exposure in the Company. Accordingly, the Company 
has approached SBI and process of opening such current accounts for its branches with SBI is on.  
 
For further information, see “Risk Factors – Risk Factor #1 – Scheduled commercial banks and payment banks have 
been directed not to open and maintain current accounts for customers who have availed credit facilities in the form 
of cash credit (CC)/overdraft (OD) from the banking system. Implementation of the aforesaid direction without 
providing alternate mechanism for financial institutions transacting with scheduled commercial banks and payment 
banks to withdraw and deposit cash may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial Condition.”

complaint filed by K. P. Varghese before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Trivandrum ("Chief Judicial Magistrate”), 
alleging that exorbitant interest rate is being charged on loans granted by our Company. As per the provisions of the 
Kerala Money Lenders Act and Kerala Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest Act, charging interest beyond the 
rates mentioned therein is an offence and hence the complaint is filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate. Since the 
Company, being an RBI regulated entity, is not coming under the preview of the said Acts, the Company has filed a 
Writ Petition before the Hon’ble High Court, Kerala to protect its interest. The said writ petition was admitted and the 
proceedings before the Chief Judicial Magistrate were stayed. Subsequently, the accused were discharged under 
Section 245(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure vide order dated June 13, 2023 by the Chief Judicial Magistrate.  
2. The service tax department has initiated prosecution against Thomas John Muthoot consequent to a tax claim made on 
another concern. Technically such prosecution will not lie as no claim was made by the department against Thomas 
John Muthoot. Also, all actions on the assessment made by the department are currently stayed by the appellate tribunal. 
However, based on a departmental circular, wherein it is mentioned that the they can even initiate criminal action in 
cases which are stayed by the Tribunal, the department has initiated prosecution before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, 
Kochi. However, the same is challenged before the high court and the court was pleased to grant a stay in the matter.  
3. The Registrar of Companies, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, had filed a complaint before the Special Judge for Economic 
Offences at Hyderabad against the erstwhile directors of Nagarjuna Finance Limited (“NFL”) including Mr. A.P. 
Kurian seeking conviction against the accused persons on the ground of violations of the order dated February 29, 
2000, passed by the Company Law Board. The Registrar of Companies, Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad, also prayed that 
the accused be directed to pay the amount due to the depositors of NFL. Mr. A.P. Kurian and others filed discharge 
petitions in the matter and the court discharged them from the case, pursuant to the order dated May 2, 2005. Aggrieved 
by the above order, the Registrar of Companies, Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad, filed Criminal Revision Case 1305/2005 
in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh. The matter is currently pending. 
4. Legal Metrology Department had filed a complaint under the sections 190 and 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code 
before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Manjeri against the Company in 2019. Thereafter summons was issued 
to the Directors of the Company as well. The offence alleged is that lesser weight is mentioned in the pledge card as 
against the original weight and hence the allegation is that the customer will get cheated since the company is liable 
to return only the weight mentioned in the pledge card. However, in reality we mention both the gross and net weight 
of the ornaments and for the purpose of considering the weight of ornaments for pledge we rely upon the net weight 
which is after nominal deduction towards impurities and / stones. As the allegation is baseless. We have moved the 
Kerala High Court for quashing the proceedings and the matter has been stayed. The stay was extended by an interim 
order dated February 19, 2020. Stay has further been extended for a period of two months vide order dated February 
3, 2023. The matter is still pending. 
5. Abdul Kahder (“Complainant”) filed an FIR on April 28, 2016 under Sections 457 and 380 of the Indian Penal Code

submitted by an investigating officer before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad on September 16, 2020 
against Mohammed Sameer for allegedly stealing the gold ornaments and mortgaging the same with MFL, which were 
subsequently sold through an auction. This matter is currently pending.

1. The Company issued a purchase order to R K Sales, a proprietary concern for the supply of doors, wardrobe, etc. for 
its 5 star hotel at Trivandrum. The said party supplied defective goods which it agreed to replace as per communications 
with MPG Hotels. However, the replaced goods were also defective and hence MPG Hotels procured the goods from 
other suppliers. Since the party supplied inferior quality goods, MPG Hotels did not pay for the said goods. The party 
filed a claim petition before UP State Micro & Small Enterprises Facilitation Council and preliminary objection was 
filed by MPG Hotels. However, pending conciliation, the Council passed an order directing to pay an amount of ₹ 
92,69,453 and an interest of ₹ 97,89,300.41, aggregating to a total of ₹ 1,90,58,753.41. Aggrieved by the said award, 
MPG Hotels has filed the Writ Petition. The order of the council is stayed by the Allahabad, High Court. The matter is 
pending for hearing and disposal. 
 
2. MPG Hotels built a software complex Muthoot Technopolis within the Cochin Special Economic Zone Authority 
(“CSEZA”), wherein software companies are the occupants. CSEZA is the distribution licensee for electricity supply. 
MPG Hotels was to provide electricity supply connections to sub-lessee/purchasers in Muthoot Technopolis and to 
collect charges. At all times the MPG Hotels performed as per the conditions laid down by CSEZA. This licensee 
CSEZA has no case that, MPG Hotels violated any of the conditions stipulated therein. As required by the licensee and 
as insisted, MPG Hotels shared electricity from High Tension (“HT”) electric connection with the subleases/purchasers 
of Muthoot Technopolis. The licensee never asked MPG Hotels to collect electricity duty @ 10% of energy charges 
from the subleases / purchasers and never required MPG Hotels to remit it to the licensee or to the state government. 
The licensee collected electricity duty at HT rates for the entire consumption of electricity metered at the point of 
supply. As a consumer of HT electricity under CSEZA distribution licensee, MPG Hotels did everything as required 
by the licensee only. Thereby, MPG Hotels is not at all liable to pay electricity duty applicable to Low Tension (“LT”) 
electricity supply which was never used by MPG Hotels and which was used by others as required by the licensee. A 
demand notice for ₹ 91,09,820.00 towards electricity duty arrears for the period from April, 2011 to March, 2016 dated 
March 2, 2017 has been issued to MPG Hotels. A writ petition has been filed by MPG Hotels praying to quash the 
demand notice and notice of disconnection. The court has stayed the operation of the notice of disconnection. Matter is 
currently pending. 
 
B. Tax Litigation  
 
1. The Tahsildar of Kanayannur Taluk has raised a demand of ₹56,07,000 towards building tax in respect of the 
Technopolis building at Kakkanad and the company has obtained stay from the Hon High Court of Kerala against 
enforcement of the demand.  An amount of ₹28,03,500 has been remitted by the Company based on the interim order 
of the High Court.  The management is confident of succeeding on the case in the High Court on the ground that 
property tax is not leviable on buildings in SEZ. 
2. The Assistant commissioner (Assessment), Commercial Taxes has raised a demand of ₹6,17,217 towards KGST 
assessment for the year 2005-06. The appeal filed by the company before the Deputy Commissioner (Appeals), 
Commercial Taxes against the said order is pending disposal and the management hopes to succeed on the appeal. 
3. The Assistant Commissioner- III (Assessment), Commercial Taxes has raised a demand of ₹1,13,905 towards KVAT 
assessment for the year 2013-14. An appeal has been filed by the company before The Deputy Commissioner (Appeals), 
Commercial Taxes against the said order, which is pending disposal. The company has paid an amount aggregating to 
₹22,781, being 20% of the demand raised under protest. The management is hopeful of succeeding on appeal and hence 
no provision has been made in respect of the above. 
4. The Company has provided security bond furnished in Form No.6 of KVAT rules towards the demand of security 
deposit raised by the Commercial Tax department for purchase of capital goods from Serta Mattress for ₹10,63,060. 
The company has disputed the demand on grounds of fact stating that levy is basically not permitted by law and the 
matter is pending for proceedings before the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes. 
MPG Security Group Pvt Ltd (“MPGSG”) 
 
5. MPGSG has availed various services from OM Security and Services, Ideas Innovation Squared Technologies Pvt 
Limited and Softcall Cust-O-Care Pvt. Ltd in their regular course of business. Further, MPGSG has availed GST input 
credit against such services availed and charges paid to such service providers. It appears that these service providers 
have filed their GST returns after their respective due dates and therefore, the department has taken a stand that MPGSG 
is ineligible for the credit claimed. The State Tax Officer, Central Tax, Thane, Maharashtra ("State Tax Officer”) 
issued a show-cause notice to MPGSG dated March 11, 2022, for an amount of ₹ 13,16,326. The matter has been closed 
vide order dated November 11, 2022.

1. MEPL was the consignment agent of M/s. Rajesh Exports Ltd. (“REL”).  MEPL sold the gold ornaments supplied by 
REL on commission basis.  MEPL had not paid the Service Tax on commission earlier but remitted along with interest 
before the issuance of the show cause notice.  But department imposed 100% penalty of ₹ 82,04,594 under section 78 
with an additional penalty of ₹ 10,000 under section 77 of the Finance Act, 1994 even after remitting the Service Tax 
with interest.  The provisions of Section 78 provide that where penalty demanded has been paid within 30 days from 
the date of receipt of the Order, 25% of the demanded amount may be paid along with interest to conclude the demand.  
MEPL has remitted 25% of the demanded amount of ₹ 20,51,150 and ₹ 10,000 within the said 30 days and filed an 
appeal before CESTAT against the order. The matter is pending. 
 
2. We, MEPL received a notice (33871122485/2020/A3 Dated 14/02/2020) from the commercial tax department, Tamil 
Nadu towards the CST assessment FY 2015-16 and 2016-17 with a demand amount of ₹ 22,34,708.  Department asked 
us to produce the books of accounts along with F Form. We have submitted all the documents and cleared all the 
queries except F Form as it must be issued from the Maharashtra commercial tax department.  We have forwarded a 
request to the MVAT department to get the F Form.  But they have not yet given the timeline to issue the F Form as 
they will consider the request based on the FIFO method.  We have intimated the same to the Tamil Nadu commercial 
tax department, but the assessing officer denied giving extension and also, they have withheld the demand amount of 
₹22,34,708 in Current Account.  
3. We have filed a writ petition on 25/02/2020 before hon’ble high court of Madras by paying 25% of the demand amount 
(₹5,58,800) to the Tamil Nadu VAT department and successfully released the lien amount from the bank. Considering 
the delay in receiving the Form F from Maharashtra, our consultant advised to pay the balance liability amount of ₹ 
18,40,567/- and we can apply for refund once we get the required forms. Thereby we have fulfilled the liability and 
now awaiting the Form F from Maharashtra to proceed further.  
 
4. MEPL received a demand order (MUM-VAT-E-822/27450710371C/CST/CST/2020-21/2521131 dated 30/06/2020) 
from the commercial tax department of Maharashtra towards the CST assessment FY 2015-16 with a demand amount 
of ₹ 29,50,565.  Department asked us to produce the books of accounts along with F form and C form. We have 
submitted all the documents and cleared all the queries except F form and C form as it must be issued from the 
Commercial tax department of various states.  We have co-ordinated with our consultants to get the required forms 
from respective states.  But they have not yet given the timeline to issue the F form and C forms considering the 
pandemic situation (Lockdown).  We have intimated the same with the Maharashtra commercial tax department, but 
the assessing officer denied giving extension and they have withheld the demand amount of ₹29,50,565 in Current 
Account.  
 
We have filed an appeal to Maharashtra VAT department on April 17, 2021 for getting extension towards the 
submission of required documents and also to release the withheld amount. Now awaiting revert from the MVAT 
department to know the status of our appeal application and way forward.

NCDs by reason of the death of the original holder(s), will, in accordance with Rule 19 and Section 56 of the Companies 
Act, 2013, be entitled to the same benefits to which he or she will be entitled if he or she were the registered holder of the 
NCDs. Where the nominee is a minor, the holder(s) may make a nomination to appoint, in Form No. SH.14, any person to 
become entitled to NCDs in the event of the holder’s death during minority. A nomination will stand rescinded on a 
sale/transfer/alienation of NCDs by the person nominating. A buyer will be entitled to make a fresh nomination in the 
manner prescribed. Fresh nomination can be made only on the prescribed form available on request at our Registered 
Office, Corporate Office or with the Registrar to the Issue.  
 
Debenture Holder(s) are advised to provide the specimen signature of the nominee to us to expedite the transmission of the 
NCD(s) to the nominee in the event of demise of the Debenture Holder(s). The signature can be provided in the Application 
Form or subsequently at the time of making fresh nominations. This facility of providing the specimen signature of the 
nominee is purely optional. 
 
In accordance with Rule 19, any person who becomes a nominee by virtue of the Rule 19, will on the production of such 
evidence as may be required by the Board, elect either: 
 
• to register himself or herself as the holder of the NCDs; or 
 
• to make such transfer of the NCDs, as the deceased holder could have made. 
 
Further, the Board may at any time give notice requiring any nominee to choose either to be registered himself or herself 
or to transfer the NCDs, and if the notice is not complied with, within a period of 90 days, the Board may thereafter withhold 
payment of all interests or redemption amounts or other monies payable in respect of the NCDs, until the requirements of 
the notice have been complied with. 
 
For all NCDs held in the dematerialized form, nominations registered with the respective Depository Participant of the 
Applicant would prevail. If the Investors require changing their nomination, they are requested to inform their respective 
Depository Participant in connection with NCDs held in the dematerialized form. 
 
A nomination may be cancelled or varied by nominating any other person in place of the present nominee, by the Debenture 
Holder who has made the nomination, by giving a notice of such cancellation or variation in the prescribed manner as per 
applicable laws. The cancellation or variation shall take effect from the date on which the notice of such variation or 
cancellation is received. 
 
For all NCDs held in the dematerialised form and since the allotment of NCDs pursuant to this Issue will be made only in 
dematerialized mode, there is no need to make a separate nomination with our Company. The nominations registered with

Succession 
 
Where NCDs are held in joint names and one of the joint holders dies, the survivor(s) will be recognized as the Debenture 
Holder(s). It will be sufficient for our Company to delete the name of the deceased Debenture Holder after obtaining 
satisfactory evidence of his death. Provided, a third person may call on our Company to register his name as successor of 
the deceased Debenture Holder after obtaining evidence such as probate of a will for the purpose of proving his title to the 
debentures. In the event of demise of the sole or first holder of the Debentures, the Company will recognise the executors 
or administrator of the deceased Debenture Holders, or the holder of the succession certificate or other legal representative 
as having title to the Debentures only if such executor or administrator obtains and produces probate or letter of 
administration or is the holder of the succession certificate or other legal representation, as the case may be, from an 
appropriate court in India. The directors of the Company in their absolute discretion may, in any case, dispense with 
production of probate or letter of administration or succession certificate or other legal representation. In case of death of 
Debenture Holders who are holding NCDs in dematerialised form, third person is not required to approach the Company 
to register his name as successor of the deceased Debenture Holder. He shall approach the respective Depository Participant 
of the Debenture Holder for this purpose and submit necessary documents as required by the Depository Participant. 
 
Where a non-resident Indian becomes entitled to the NCDs by way of succession, the following steps have to be complied 
with: 
 
1. Documentary evidence to be submitted to the Legacy Cell of the RBI to the effect that the NCDs were acquired by the 
non-resident Indian as part of the legacy left by the deceased Debenture Holder. 
 
2. Proof that the non-resident Indian is an Indian national or is of Indian origin. 
 
3.  Such holding by a non-resident Indian will be on a non-repatriation basis.

Where two or more persons are holders of any NCD(s), they shall be deemed to hold the same as joint holders with benefits 
of survivorship subject to other provisions contained in the Articles.

The procedure for redemption is set out below: 
 
NCDs held in physical form on account of re-materialization:  
 
No action would ordinarily be required on the part of the Debenture Holder at the time of redemption and the redemption 
proceeds would be paid to those Debenture Holders whose names stand in the register of Debenture Holders maintained 
by us on the Record Date fixed for the purpose of redemption. However, our Company may require that the NCD 
certificate(s), duly discharged by the sole holder/all the joint-holders (signed on the reverse of the NCD certificate(s)) be 
surrendered for redemption on maturity and should be sent by the Debenture Holder(s) by Registered Post with 
acknowledgment due or by hand delivery to our office or to such persons at such addresses as may be notified by us from 
time to time. Debenture Holder(s) may be requested to surrender the NCD certificate(s) in the manner as stated above, not 
more than three months and not less than one month prior to the redemption date so as to facilitate timely payment. 
 
We may at our discretion redeem the NCDs without the requirement of surrendering of the NCD certificates by the holder(s) 
thereof. In case we decide to do so, the holders of NCDs need not submit the NCD certificates to us and the redemption 
proceeds would be paid to those Debenture Holders whose names stand in the register of Debenture Holders maintained 
by us on the Record Date fixed for the purpose of redemption of NCDs. In such case, the NCD certificates would be deemed 
to have been cancelled. Also see “Terms of the Issue - Payment on Redemption” on page 115. 
 
NCDs held in electronic form:  
 
No action is required on the part of Debenture Holder(s) at the time of redemption of NCDs.  
 
Payment on Redemption  
 
The manner of payment of redemption is set out below: 
 
NCDs held in physical form on account of re-materialisation 
 
The payment on redemption of the NCDs will be made by way of cheque/pay order/ electronic modes. However, if our 
Company so requires, the aforementioned payment would only be made on the surrender of NCD certificate(s), duly 
discharged by the sole holder / all the joint-holders (signed on the reverse of the NCD certificate(s)). Dispatch of 
cheques/pay order, etc. in respect of such payment will be made on the redemption date or (if so requested by our Company 
in this regard) within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of the duly discharged NCD certificate. 
 
In case we decide to do so, the redemption proceeds in the manner stated above would be paid on the redemption date to 
those Debenture Holders whose names stand in the Register of Debenture Holders maintained by us/Registrar to the Issue 
on the Record Date fixed for the purpose of redemption. Hence the transferees, if any, should ensure lodgement of the 
transfer documents with us at least 15 (fifteen) days prior to the Record Date. In case the transfer documents are not lodged 
with us at least 15 (fifteen) days prior to the Record Date and we dispatch the redemption proceeds to the transferor, claims

in respect of the redemption proceeds should be settled amongst the parties inter se and no claim or action shall lie against 
us or the Registrar.  
 
Our liability to holder(s) towards their rights including for payment or otherwise shall stand extinguished from the date of 
redemption in all events and when we dispatch the redemption amounts to the Debenture Holder(s).  
 
Further, we will not be liable to pay any interest, income or compensation of any kind from the date of redemption of the 
NCD(s).  
 
NCDs held in electronic form 
 
On the redemption date, redemption proceeds would be paid by cheque /pay order / electronic mode to those Debenture 
Holders whose names appear on the list of beneficial owners given by the Depositories to us. These names would be as per 
the Depositories’ records on the Record Date fixed for the purpose of redemption. These NCDs will be simultaneously 
extinguished to the extent of the amount redeemed through appropriate debit corporate action upon redemption of the 
corresponding value of the NCDs. It may be noted that in the entire process mentioned above, no action is required on the 
part of Debenture Holders.  
 
Our liability to Debenture Holder(s) towards his/their rights including for payment or otherwise shall stand extinguished 
from the date of redemption in all events and when we dispatch the redemption amounts to the Debenture Holder(s).  
 
Further, we will not be liable to pay any interest, income or compensation of any kind from the date of redemption of the 
NCD(s). 
 
Right to reissue NCD(s)  
 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, where we have fully redeemed or repurchased any NCD(s), we shall 
have and shall be deemed always to have had the right to keep such NCDs in effect without extinguishment thereof, for 
the purpose of resale or reissue and in exercising such right, we shall have and be deemed always to have had the power to 
resell or reissue such NCDs either by reselling or reissuing the same NCDs or by issuing other NCDs in their place. The 
aforementioned right includes the right to reissue original NCDs.

the Applicants should not submit the GIR number instead of the PAN as the Application is liable to be rejected on 
this ground.

Application and shall be rejected. However, multiple Applications by the same individual Applicant aggregating to a 
value exceeding ₹ 10 lakhs shall be deemed such individual Applicant to be an HNI Applicant and all such Applications

any Application made by any person in his individual capacity and an Application made by such person in his capacity as

Application. For the purposes of allotment of NCDs under this Issue, Applications shall be grouped based on the PAN, i.e. 
Applications under the same PAN shall be grouped together and treated as one Application. Two or more Applications will 
be deemed to be multiple Applications if the sole or first Applicant is one and the same. For the sake of clarity, two or 
more applications shall be deemed to be a multiple Application for the aforesaid purpose if the PAN number of the sole or 
the first Applicant is one and the same.

Dear Mr. R. Nadanasabapathy, 
 
Re: Review of CRISIL Rating on the Non Convertible Debentures Aggregating Rs.1100 Crore^ of Muthoot Fincorp 
Limited 
 
All ratings assigned by CRISIL Ratings are kept under continuous surveillance and review. 
 
CRISIL Ratings has, after due consideration, reaffirmed its CRISIL AA-/Stable (pronounced as CRISIL double A minus rating 
with Stable outlook) rating on the captioned debt instrument. Securities with this rating are considered to have high degree of 
safety regarding timely servicing of financial obligations. Such securities carry very low credit risk. 
 
In the event of your company not making the issue within a period of 180 days from the above date, or in the event of any change 
in the size or structure of your proposed issue, a fresh letter of revalidation from CRISIL Ratings will be necessary. 
 
As per our Rating Agreement, CRISIL Ratings would disseminate the rating along with outlook through its publications and other 
media, and keep the rating along with outlook under surveillance for the life of the instrument. CRISIL Ratings reserves the right 
to withdraw, or revise the rating / outlook assigned to the captioned instrument at any time, on the basis of new information, or 
unavailability of information, or other circumstances which CRISIL Ratings believes may have an impact on the rating. Please 
visit www.crisilratings.com and search with the name of the rated entity to access the latest rating/s. 
 
As per SEBI circular (reference number: CIR/IMD/DF/17/2013; dated October 22, 2013) on centralized database for corporate 
bonds/debentures, you are required to provide international securities identification number (ISIN; along with the reference 
number and the date of the rating letter) of all bond/debenture issuances made against this rating letter to us. The circular also 
requires you to share this information with us within 2 days after the allotment of the ISIN. We request you to mail us all the 
necessary and relevant information at debtissue@crisil.com. This will enable CRISIL Ratings to verify and confirm to the 
depositories, including NSDL and CDSL, the ISIN details of debt rated by us, as required by SEBI. Feel free to contact us at 
debtissue@crisil.com for any clarification you may need. 
 
Should you require any clarification, please feel free to get in touch with us. 
 
With warm regards,

1 crore = 10 million
Refer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities
 
Detailed Rationale
CRISIL Ratings has assigned its ‘CRISIL AA-/Stable’ rating to Rs 100 crore of Subordinated debt, Rs 806.26 crore of Non-
convertible Debenture of Muthoot Fincorp Limited (MFL; flagship company of Muthoot Pappachan group [MPG]). The rating on
other debt instruments and bank facilities has been reaffirmed at ‘CRISIL AA-/CRISIL PPMLD AA-/CRISIL A/Stable/CRISIL A1+’.
 
CRISIL Ratings has withdrawn its rating on Non Convertible Debentures of Rs 326.3 crore (See Annexure 'Details of rating
withdrawn' for details) in line with its withdrawal policy. CRISIL Ratings has received independent confirmation that these
instruments are fully redeemed. 
 
The rating continues to reflect MFL’s healthy performance and strong market position in the core gold loan portfolio, as indicated
by steady growth in assets under management (AUM), sound asset quality.
 
Gold loan portfolio accounts for around 57% of the group’s overall AUM as on March 31, 2023 and stood at Rs 17,942 crore
(including co-lending of Rs 1153 crore). The non-gold loan portfolio accounted for around 43% of the total MPG portfolio as on
March 31, 2023. Out of this, the microfinance business accounted for Rs 9,180 crore AUM as on March 31, 2023, while the AUM
of vehicle and housing finance stood at Rs 2,102 crore and Rs 1,520 crore, respectively. The non-gold portfolio has faced
increased asset quality challenges especially in the aftermath of the second wave of pandemic. The management remains
cautious with continued focus on increasing collection efficiency. Also, they have made higher provisions buffers which are
sufficient to cover any further asset quality challenges.
 
The capital position was supported by the capital infusion at both standalone level and in the microfinance subsidiary.
Consequently, the networth at the consolidated level increased to Rs 4904 crore in fiscal 2023 as compared to Rs 3,595 crore in
fiscal 2021. Moreover, net gearing (adjusted for cash and real estate assets) at the standalone level improved to 4.2 times in
fiscal 2023 as compared to 4.8 times in fiscal 2022 and at consolidated level improved to 5.8 times in fiscal 2023 as compared to
6.0 times in fiscal 2022.

The ratings are further supported by promoters’ extensive experience in the loan-against-gold jewellery business, its established
market position in the gold business and diversified product profile of MPG. These strengths are partially offset by geographical
concentration in portfolio and potential challenges associated with non-gold loan segments.
Analytical Approach
For arriving at the ratings, CRISIL Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of MFL (engaged in businesses
of financing against gold jewellery, financing micro and small and medium enterprises [MSMEs]), Muthoot Microfin Limited (MML;
microfinance), Muthoot Capital Services Limited (MCSL; two-wheeler finance and MSME loans), and Muthoot Housing Finance
Company Limited (MHFCL; housing finance). This is because all the companies, collectively referred to as the MPG, have
significant financial, managerial and operational linkages. MML and MHFCL are subsidiaries of MFL while the promoters hold a
62.5% stake in MCSL. Furthermore, MFL has exposure to real estate assets which stood at Rs 451 crore (1.9% of total assets as
of March 31, 2023). CRISIL Ratings notionally allocates a part of networth towards such asset acquisition so as to simulate a
funding model for these assets, with low gearing (debt:equity) of 0.5 time.
Please refer Annexure - List of entities consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation
Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description
Strengths:
Established market position in gold financing, supported by extensive experience of the promoters
MFL has established market position in the gold financing. The promoters have spent over seven decades in the business of
lending against gold jewellery. Over the years, the group has established a strong reputation and brand in South India and has
an appropriate assessment and underwriting methodology. MFL’s gold loan business grew at steady rate of 22% compound
annual growth rate (CAGR) over fiscals 2018 to 2020 and 21% in fiscal 2021 despite increase in competition from banks and
having a regulatory loan-to-value (LTV) disadvantage during last fiscal. However, in fiscal 2022, higher volatility in gold prices
between January and April 2021 followed by localised lockdown impose by states to curb the impact of the second wave of
covid-19 impacted the branch operations and disbursements during first half of current fiscal. This coupled with higher auctions in
Q3 of fiscal 2022, MFL’s gold loan AUM stood at Rs 18,125 crore as of March 2022 as compared to Rs 18,701 crore as of March
2021. In fiscal 2023, MFL’s gold loans AUM stood at Rs 17,942 crore. The total gold holding stood at around 48.09 tonnes on of
March 31, 2023 (51 tonnes as on March 31, 2020) owing to decline in the gold loan portfolio. During fiscal 2023, the company
disbursed 40,065 crore as compared to Rs 35,154 crore in fiscal 2022. The AUM per branch stood at Rs 5.2 crore as on March
31, 2023, as compared to Rs ~3.6 crore in fiscal 2019.
 
Diversified product profile of the MPG group
MPG has diversified its product profile over the past few years. Currently, the group operates in five major segments: loan
against gold jewellery, two-wheeler finance, microfinance, housing finance and small business loans. Overall managed AUM of
MPG is around Rs 31,587 crore as on March 31, 2023 (Rs 28,308 crore as on March 31, 2022). The proportion of gold loans has
remained high at 57% in March 2023 compared to 64% in March 2022. The microfinance portfolio is the second largest with
around 29% of overall portfolio of the group as on March 31, 2023. CRISIL Ratings believes that the gold loans will continue to
hold the largest share in the consolidated AUM over the medium term.
 
Improvement in capitalisation with the recent infusion
MFL’s networth, at standalone level, stood at Rs 4,050 crore (including CCCPS) as on March 31, 2023 as against Rs 3,602 crore
as on March 31, 2022. Capitalisation is further supported by low asset-side risks (security of gold jewellery, which is liquid and in
the lender’s possession). On a consolidated level, networth stood at Rs 4,904 crore (including CCCPS) as on March 31, 2023,
against Rs 4,271 crore as on March 31, 2022 which was bolstered by $50 million in MML by a PE investor Greater Pacific Capital
in fiscal 2022 and $10 million in September 2022. Moreover, net gearing (adjusted for cash and real estate assets) at the
standalone level improved to 4.2 times in fiscal 2023 as compared to 4.8 times in fiscal 2022 and at consolidated level improved
to 5.8 times in fiscal 2023 as compared to 6.0 times in fiscal 2022.
 
Furthermore, MFL’s exposure to real estate assets has reduced to Rs 451 crore in March 2023 (1.9% of total assets) as
compared to Rs 540 crore (2.2% of total assets) as on March 31, 2022 down from Rs 876 crore as on March 31, 2017 (6.5% of
total assets). The management is expected to maintain gearing at current level over the medium term. Any material increase in
gearing beyond current thresholds will be a key rating sensitivity factor.
 
Healthy asset quality in the gold loan segment to support overall group asset quality
The gross NPAs for MFL stood at 2.11% as on March 31, 2023 against 2.88% as on March 31, 2022. Further there is a negligible
impact of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) clarification released in November 2021 on the NPAs as gold loans are demand loans
where the interest and principal amount are due for payment at the end of tenor. However, CRISIL Ratings notes that due to
asset quality issues and the pandemic, the company, incrementally, has reduced its exposure to the SME segment and has
started focusing primarily on gold loan products. The proportion of SME loans has reduced further to around 4% of the overall
group’s AUM as on March 31, 2023, from 8% as on March 31, 2018. Additionally, company is doing regular auctions of gold
loans which would help in reducing GNPA below 1% in gold loans. In the gold loan segment, MFL has maintained healthy asset
quality over the years, backed by strong collection efficiency. Asset quality, as better measured by credit costs, has also been
under control within 0.5% during this period for gold loans. In fiscal 2023, credit cost stood at 0.3%. Post second wave of covid,
company has been doing regular auctions since June 2021. Furthermore, company is focusing on short tenure (6-month) gold
loan product compared to average 9-month product in the previous fiscal. This should help MFL de-risk the portfolio from any
sharp movements in gold prices in the near term.
 
Improving earnings profile for gold loan business
MFL's profitability, on standalone basis, has improved over the last 2-3 years on account of higher returns from the gold business
during the pandemic, steady reduction in overall opex cost over the years and overall low credit costs. RoMA improved
significantly to 1.7% in fiscal 2021 compared to just 1.2% and 1.0% in fiscal 2020 and 2018, respectively. In fiscal 2022, MFL
reported slight reduction in RoMA to 1.5% owing to slight decline in NIMs and rise in operating cost associated with core banking
migration and rise in employee benefit expense. In fiscal 2023, RoMA improved at 1.9%. If we adjust for non-interest bearing
assets, profitability improves to 2.4% in fiscal 2023. MFL has maintained its focus on regular interest collection which may reduce

loss on interest income, if any, on auction of pledged jewellery. Furthermore, with the current trend in gold prices, the company is
not expecting any issues with respect to interest losses.
 
On a consolidated level, RoMA improved to 2.0%  in fiscal 2023 as compared to 0.7% in fiscal 2022. MFL’s profitability is
expected to support the consolidated profitability. Additionally, with the improvement in the earning profile of subsidiaries and
MCSL, overall profitability is expected to improve further in fiscal 2024. As of March 2023, MML has total provisioning buffer of Rs
172 crore (1.9% of the total book). Given the higher provisioning buffer, company is well placed to cover any further asset quality
challenges. Additionally, the removal of interest rate cap as per new RBI directives is expected to bolster the profitability of the
company. Similarly, MCSL is carrying a huge provision buffer of Rs 393 crore (18.7% of the on book portfolio as of March 31,
2023), write backs are also expected in the current fiscal in addition to the improving profitability on account of expected growth.
Therefore, profitability of MPG is expected to improve steadily over the medium term. However, the group’s ability to manage
earnings primarily within non-gold segments will be monitored.
 
Weakness:
Geographical concentration in portfolio
High geographical concentration persists, with South India accounting for around 60% of the gold loan portfolio as on March 31,
2023 (as compared to 70% as on March 31, 2019). This was achieved by increase in per branch business from branches other
than southern branches, opening of new branches in North, East and South and closure or merger of non-viable branches in
South India. At the MPG level, around 80% of AUM is concentrated in South Indian states. While the level of concentration has
been declining, it is higher than that of its peers. Presently, the demand for gold loans has been high in the region. Therefore, the
proportion of AUM from the South region may not decline further in the current fiscal.
 
Potential challenges associated with non-gold loan segments
The non-gold segments accounted for 43% of the overall portfolio as on March 31, 2023. While MPG has managed to grow
these businesses and increase the segmental share over the last 2-3 years, potential challenges linked to seasoning of the loan
book and asset quality remain. In fiscal 2023, microfinance portfolio and housing finance portfolio has registered a double-digit
growth of 47% and 14% respectively and vehicle loan portfolio grew by only 2.2%.
 
However, asset quality in both microfinance and vehicle finance segments has witnessed deterioration. The 90+ dpd level for
MML stood at 5.1% as on March 31, 2023 (6.8% as on March 31, 2022). The GNPA in case of MCSL stood at 20.55% as on
March 31, 2023 as against 25.9% as on March 31, 2022. The 90+ dpd for MHFCL stood at 0.8% as on March 31, 2023 (3.9% as
on March 31, 2022). 
 
The microfinance and vehicle finance businesses are more prone to risks arising due to the pandemic. Nevertheless, post
September 2020, CRISIL Ratings has observed substantial improvement in the collection efficiency within the vehicle finance
segment. The microfinance segment has also witnessed improvement in its collections consistently during the last quarter of
fiscal 2021. However, due to the second wave of Covid 19, collection efficiency dropped in the month of April 2021 and further in
the month of May 2021. However, it has picked up from June 2021 onwards. CRISIL Ratings believes that the consolidated credit
profile will be able to absorb asset quality risks in the microfinance, vehicle or housing finance businesses in the near
term. Furthermore, the non-gold segments are recovering post the pandemic. Nevertheless, CRISIL Ratings will continue to
closely monitor the delinquency trend and collection efficiencies in the non-gold loan segments in the near term. Additionally,
sufficiency of capital buffers to withstand asset-side shocks remains a key rating sensitivity factor.
Liquidity: Strong
As per Asset Liability Management (ALM) statement of March 31, 2023, MFL, on standalone basis, has cumulative positive gaps
in the upto 1 year bucket. As on June 30, 2023, MFL had liquidity of Rs 1,902 crore (Rs 1,179 crore of cash and equivalent and
Rs 723 crore of CC/WCDL). Against this, they have total debt repayments (including operating expense) of Rs 1,535 crore in the
next three months. The total debt repayments exclude CC / WCDL limits which are typically rolled over. CRISIL Ratings notes
that MFL has been able to rollover the CC/WCDL limits in the past and also during the previous three months and expects to be
able to rollover the balance limits falling due in coming months.
 
In terms of collections, the company had average collections of around Rs 3,997 crore on monthly basis during the Q4 2023. In
terms of additional funding, In fiscal 2023, MFL has raised Rs 3155 crore in the form of terms and CP. While a larger proportion
of borrowing has been sourced as funding lines from banks and financial institutions such as term loans (30.1%) and CC/WCDL
(40.1%), the company’s resource profile remained diversified across avenues, such as NCDs (19.0%) and subordinated debt
(10.9%) as on March 31, 2023.
Outlook: Stable
CRISIL Ratings believes MFL’s business profile will continue to be supported by its established market position in the gold loan
segment.

Downward Factors
Deterioration in asset quality with GNPAs increasing and remaining above 5%

designed 
our

procedures

accordance with Lhe guidelines laid down 
in the Standard on Auditing (SA 530) and 
tested Lhe controls in the Information

At the branch level, entries related to daily 
operations are passed. We have addressed 
this as a key audit matter since any control 
lapses in the branch level accounting may

Holding Company's branches on a sample 
basis to identify and assess the effectiveness 
of U1e controls operating at Lhe branch level. 
We have also tested on a sample basis the 
independent financial records maintained 
at the branch level and how the same is

We have also assessed and analyzed the

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included 111 lhe Group and of it:, 
associates and jointly controlled entities are responsible for overseeing the financial 
reporting process of the Group and of its associates and jointly controlled entities. 
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS FinanciaJ Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated l.nd AS 
Financial statements as a whole are free from malerial misstalement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a h:igh level of assurance, but is not a guarantee lhat an audit conducted in accordance with 
SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or en-or and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they couJd 
reasonably be expected to innuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these Consolidated ln<l AS financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professionaJ judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism Lhroughout Lhe auilit. We also: 
•
lJentify anJ assess the risks of material misstatement of the Conso(jdated Ind AS
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit
procedtues responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opitlion. The risk of not detecting a materiaJ
nusstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional onfr,sions, misrepre!'lentations, or,
the override of in Lerna! control.
•
Obtain an underslc1nding of internal financial controls relevant to the auJit in order
to design audit procedmes that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section
143(3)(1) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether
the Group has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating
l;'f(ectiveness of such controls.
•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and Lhe reasonableness ol
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management
•
Conclude on Lhe appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions U,at may cast si
the Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities to co
concern. lf we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are

Our conclusions are based on lhe audit evidence obtained up to the date of our

lhe entities or business activities within the Group and its associates and jointly

From U1e matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in Lhc auc.l.it of the consolidated financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in

when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outwetgh the public interest benefits of such communication.

ANNEXURE "A" TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
Referred to in Paragraph 1(£) tinder 'Report on other Legal and Regulatory
Requirements' of the Independent Auditors' Report of even date to the members of 
Muthoot Fincorp Limited on the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements as of and 
for the year ended 31st March, 2023. 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i)
of Sub section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act"): 
In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidateu lnu AS Financial Statements of the 
Company as of and for the year endeJ March 31, 2023, we have audited the internal 
financial controls over financial reporting of Muthoot Fincorp Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as "the Holding Company") and its subsidiary companies, which includes 
internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company and its subsidiary 
companies, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financiaJ controls 
based on the internal control over financiaJ reporting criteria established by the 
respective Companies considering the essential components of internal conb·ol stated in
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the lnstitute of Chartered Accountants of India. TI1ese responsibilities include 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate inlernal financial controls that 
were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective com.pany's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, tJ1e accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditors' Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an oplillon on the internal financial controls over 
financial reporting of the Holding Company and its subsidiary compimies, based on our
audit We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of 
faternal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting ( the "Guidance Note") and the 
Standards on AudH:ing, both issued by the ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under 
section 143(10) of the Companies Act 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of

assurance abuut whether adequate internal financial conl1·ols over financial reporting 
was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material 
respects. 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy 
of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over fu1ancial reporting included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial repmt:ing, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtaineJ and the audit evidence obtai11ed 
by the other auditors of the subsidiary companies are sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Group's internal financial controls system 
over financial reporting. 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 
A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of fina11cial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over f
inancinl 
reporting h1cludes those policies and procedures that; (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately anJ fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recon.led as necessary to pem1_it preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and direclors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements. 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal finru1cial controls over financial reporting, 
including the possibility of col1usion or improper manageU1ent override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial con 
F 13


# Page 196
reportlng may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Opinion 
ln our opinion, to the be.<,t of our information aml acconling to the explanations given to
us and based on the consideration of the reports of the other auditors referred to in the 
Other Matters paragraph below, the Holding Company and its subsicliary companies, 
have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over 
financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were 
operating effectively as at March 31,2023 based on the criteria for internal financial 
control over financial reporting established by the respective companies considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over financial Reporting issued by the lnstitute of 
Chartered Accotmtants of Cndia. 
Other Matters 
Our aforesaid report under Section l43(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating 
effectiveness of the internal finai,c.ial controls over financial reporting in so far as it 
relates to the subsidiary companies are based solely on the corresponding reports of the 
auditors of such company.

Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Management is satisfied that the Group shall be 
able to continue its business for the foreseeable future and no material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt 
on the going concern assumption. 
2.2 Presentation of financial Statements 
The Group presents its Balance Sheet in order of liquidity.  The Group prepares and presents its Balance Sheet, the 
Statement of Profit and Loss and the Statement of Changes in Equity in the format prescribed by Division III of Schedule 
III to the Act. The Statement of Cash Flows has been prepared and presented as per the requirements of Ind AS 7 
‘Statement of Cash Flows’. 
The Group generally reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis in the Balance Sheet. They are offset 
and reported net only when Ind AS specifically permits the same or it has an unconditional legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event. Similarly, the Group offsets incomes and 
expenses and reports the same on a net basis when permitted by Ind AS specifically unless they are material in nature. 
2.3 Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Company and all its subsidiaries, 
being the entities that it controls from the date control is gained. Control is evidenced where the investor is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the investee. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, 
which significantly affect the entity’s returns. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting 
year as the Parent Company. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align 
the accounting policies in line with accounting policies of the Parent Company. 
These consolidated financial statements are prepared on the following basis in accordance with Ind AS 110 on 
“Consolidated Financial Statements” specified under Section 133 of the Act. Following subsidiary companies have been 
considered in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 
i)
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through
its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the date on which controls commences until the date on which control ceases.
ii)
Non-controlling interest (“NCI”)
NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.
Changes in the Group’s equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as
equity transactions.
iii)
Loss of control
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and
any related NCI and other component of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at
fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit and
loss.

iv) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
The financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary used in the consolidation procedure are
drawn up to the same reporting date i.e. March 31, 2023. The financial statements of the Holding Company and
its subsidiary are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Intra-group balances and transactions, and unrealized income and expenses
arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as
unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. The Group follows uniform
accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. For additional information as
required by Paragraph 2 of the General Instructions for preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements to
Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, refer Note 50.
2.4 
Basis of measurement 
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for following assets and liabilities which 
have been measured at fair value: 
i)
Investments in equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
ii)
Financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
iii)
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
iv)
Investments which are held for trading
v)
Assets held for sale are measured at fair value less cost to sell or carrying value whichever is lower
vi)
Defined benefit plans.
vii)
Derivative Financial Instruments
2.5 
Functional and presentation currency 
The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR) which is also functional currency of the Group and the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. All values are rounded to the nearest lakhs, 
except when otherwise indicated.  
3.
Significant accounting policies
3.1 
Recognition of interest income
Interest income is recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial 
assets other than credit-impaired assets and financial assets classified as measured at FVTPL. 
 The EIR in case of a financial asset is computed  
a.
As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to
the gross carrying amount of a financial asset.
b.
By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.
c.
Including all fees received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate,
transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.
Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets. 
3.2 .  Recognition of revenue from sale of goods and services 
Revenue (other than for financial instruments) is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Ind 
AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers outlines a single comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising 
from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance found within Ind ASs. 
The Group recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in Ind 115: 
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that 
creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met. 
F 21

Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a 
customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. 
Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects 
to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties. 
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than 
one performance obligation, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that 
depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance 
obligation. 
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation 
Revenue from contract with customer for rendering services is recognised at a point in time when performance obligation 
is satisfied. 
3.2.1 
Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and the amount of the dividend can be measured 
reliably. 
3.2.2 
Income from assignment transactions 
Income from assignment transactions i.e., present value of excess interest spread is recognised when the related loan 
assets are de-recognised. Interest income is also recognised on carrying value of assets over the remaining period of such 
assets. 
3.2.3 
Rental Income 
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included 
in rental income in the statement of profit and loss, unless the increase is in line with expected general inflation, in which 
case lease income is recognised based on contractual terms. 
3.2.4 
Fees and commission income 
Fees and commission income such as service charges, commission from fee-based business lines, service income etc. are 
recognised on point in time basis. 
3.2.5 
Miscellaneous Income 
All other income is recognized on an accrual basis, when there is no uncertainty in the ultimate realization/collection. 
3.3 
Financial instruments  
A.
Financial Asset
3.3.1 
Initial recognition 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Loans are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account. Investments are recognised on the date when 
the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions. The Group recognises debt securities, deposits and borrowings 
when funds reach the Group and post allotment, where applicable. 
3.3.2 Initial and subsequent measurement of financial instruments 
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: 
1.
Debt instruments at amortised cost
2.
Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).
3.
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
4.
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI.

The classification depends on the contractual terms of the financial assets’ cash flows and the Group’s business model 
for managing financial assets which are explained below: 
Business model assessment 
The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to 
achieve its business objective. 
The Group's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated 
portfolios and is based on observable factors such as: 
► How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated
and reported to the entity's key management personnel
► The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model)
and the way those risks are managed
► How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of
the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected)
► The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Group’s assessment.
► The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ 
scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group's
original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that
business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial
assets going forward.
The SPPI test 
As a second step of its classification process, the Group assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify 
whether they meet the SPPI test. 
‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may 
change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the 
premium/discount). 
In making this assessment, the Group considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending 
arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks 
and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure 
to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through the 
profit and loss account or is required to measure liabilities at fair value through profit or loss such as derivative liabilities. 
3.3.3 Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect
contractual cash flows and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement at fair value plus directly attributable costs, these financial assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by considering any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in 
interest income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in statement of profit and loss. 
3.3.4 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both the following conditions are 
met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect
contractual cash flows and selling the assets and
F 23

b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding
Debt instruments included within the FVOCI category are measured at each reporting date at fair value with such changes 
being recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI). The interest income on these assets is recognised in profit or 
loss. Impairment losses or reversals, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit and 
loss. Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified 
from equity to the income statement.  
3.3.5 Financial Instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified 
as at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments that meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria but are designated 
as at FVTPL are measured at FVTPL. 
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVOCI criteria may be designated 
as at FVTPL upon initial recognition, if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition 
inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different 
bases. 
Group’s investment is classified as FVTPL, if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or 
repurchasing in the near term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for 
which there is evidence of short-term profit taking. 
Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value, with transaction costs 
recognised in the income statement as incurred. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value and any gains or losses are 
recognised in the income statement as they arise.  
3.3.6 Equity instruments 
The Group subsequently measures investment in equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, unless the Group’s 
management has elected to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI, when 
such instruments meet the definition of definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are 
not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Gains and losses on these equity instruments classified at FVOCI are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognised in profit or loss as dividend income when the right of the payment has been established, except when the 
Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are 
recorded in OCI.  
B. Financial Liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement 
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or the issue of financial liability, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are adjusted to fair value at initial 
recognition. 
Subsequent measurement  
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
3.4 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
3.4.1 
Financial Asset 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Group also derecognises 
the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.  
The Group has transferred the financial asset if, and only if, either: 
a)
The Group has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset
or
F 24


# Page 207
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
b)
It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full
without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass–through’ arrangement
Pass-through arrangements are transactions whereby the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows 
of a financial asset (the 'original asset'), but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more 
entities (the 'eventual recipients'), when all of the following three conditions are met: 
► The Group has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it has collected equivalent amounts
from the original asset, excluding short-term advances with the right to full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued
interest at market rates
► The Group cannot sell or pledge the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients
► The Group has to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay. In
addition, the Group is not entitled to reinvest such cash flows, except for investments in cash or cash equivalents
including interest earned, during the period between the collection date and the date of required remittance to the
eventual recipients.
A transfer only qualifies for derecognition if either: 
► The Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset
or
► The Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset
The Group considers control to be transferred if and only if, the transferee has the practical ability to sell the asset in 
its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without imposing additional 
restrictions on the transfer. 
When the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and has retained control of 
the asset, the asset continues to be recognised only to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement, in which case, 
the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a 
basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained. 
3.4.2 Financial Liability 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as de recognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability 
and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. 
3.5 Offsetting 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities 
are offset, and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and 
intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously in all the following 
circumstances: 
a.
The normal course of business
b.
The event of default
c.
The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group and/or its counter parties.
3.6 Impairment of financial assets 
3.6.1 
Overview of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) principles 
The Group has created provisions on all financial assets except for financial assets classified as FVTPL, based on the 
expected credit loss method. The Group also ensures maintaining the minimum provision requirement as per RBI and 
NHB regulations. 
F 25


# Page 208
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
The ECL provision is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit 
loss), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based 
on the 12 months’ expected credit loss. The 12-month ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs that 
result from default events on financial assets that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. 
The Group performs an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk 
has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the 
remaining life of the financial instrument. 
Based on the above process, the Group categorises its loans into three stages as described below: 
For non-impaired financial instruments 

Stage 1 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have not experienced a significant increase
in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. A 12-month ECL provision is made for stage 1 financial
instruments. In assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Group compares the risk of a default
occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date, with the risk of a default occurring on the financial
instrument as at the date of initial recognition.

Stage 2 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have experienced a SICR since initial
recognition. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for stage 2 financial instruments. In subsequent reporting
periods, if the credit risk of the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a SICR since initial
recognition, then entities recognize 12 months of ECL.
For impaired financial instruments: 
Financial instruments are classified as stage 3 when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more 
loss events that have occurred after initial recognition with a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows of a loan 
or a portfolio of loans. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for impaired financial instruments. 
3.6.2 
The calculation of ECLs 
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows: 
Probability of Default (PD) - The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time 
horizon. 
The Group uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products and schemes, 
the Group has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach 
considering fresh slippage using historical information.  
Exposure at Default (EAD) - The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering 
expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether 
scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed 
payments.  
Loss Given Default (LGD) – The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs 
at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect 
to receive.  
Forward looking information 
While estimating the expected credit losses, the Group reviews macro-economic developments occurring in the economy 
and market it operates in. On a periodic basis, the Group analyses if there is any relationship between key economic 
trends like GDP, unemployment rates, benchmark rates set by the Reserve Bank of India, inﬂation etc. with the estimate 
of PD, LGD determined by the Group based on its internal data. While the internal estimates of PD, LGD rates by the 
Group may not be always reﬂective of such relationships, temporary overlays, if any, are embedded in the methodology 
to reﬂect such macro-economic trends reasonably. 
Write-offs 
Loans are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case 
when it is determined that the customer does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufﬁcient cash 
F 26


# Page 209
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
ﬂows to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are credited to the 
statement of proﬁt and loss. 
Collateral 
To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Group seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in 
various forms, such as gold, cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, stock, current asset etc. However, the fair value 
of collateral affects the calculation of ECLs. The fair value of the same is based on data provided by third party or 
management judgements. 
Impairment of Trade receivables 
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The Group 
uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix 
is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables. 
3.7 Determination of fair value 
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, investments at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
i.
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
ii.
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability, if market participants act in their economic best interest. 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits 
by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use. 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which enough data are available 
to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
The financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as summarised below: 
Level 1 financial instruments − Those where the inputs used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group has access to at the measurement date. The Group considers 
markets as active only if there are sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical 
assets or liabilities and when there are binding and exercisable price quotes available on the balance sheet date. 
Level 2 financial instruments − Those where the inputs that are used for valuation and are significant, are derived from 
directly or indirectly observable market data available over the entire period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include 
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets 
and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit 
spreads. In addition, adjustments may be required for the condition or location of the asset or the extent to which it relates 
to items that are comparable to the valued instrument. However, if such adjustments are based on unobservable inputs 
which are significant to the entire measurement, the Group will classify the instruments as Level 3. 
Level 3 financial instruments − Those that include one or more unobservable input that is signiﬁcant to the measurement 
as whole. 
3.8 Foreign Currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the spot rate of ex-change ruling at 
the date of the transaction. However, for practical reasons, the Group uses an average rate if the average approximates 
the actual rate at the date of the transaction. 
F 27


# Page 210
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot 
rate of exchange at the reporting date. All differences arising on non–trading activities are taken to other income/expense 
in the statement of profit and loss.  
Non–monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange 
rates as at the date of recognition. 
3.9 Finance cost 
Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying 
amount of financial liabilities other than financial liabilities classified as FVTPL. 
Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognized as part of the carrying value of the financial liability 
and amortized over the expected life using the effective interest method. These include fees and commissions payable 
to advisers and other expenses such as external legal costs, provided these are incremental costs that are directly related 
to the issue of a financial liability. 
3.10 Other income and expenses  
All Other income and expense are recognized in the period they occur. 
3.11  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand, short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less and forex balances, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short- term deposits, as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts, if any as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management. 
3.12   Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, 
(if any). The total cost of assets comprises its purchase price, freight, duties, taxes and any other incidental expenses 
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by the management.  
Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, 
and treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible asset are added to its gross value only if it increases the future 
benefits of the existing asset, beyond its previously assessed standards of performance and cost can be measured reliably. 
Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed off as and when incurred. 
3.13 Depreciation 
Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost comprises the purchase price and any 
attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.  
Depreciation is charged based on a review by the management during the year and at the rates derived based on the useful 
lives of the assets as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 or estimated useful lives estimated by the 
respective management based on technical evaluation. The holding company and one of its subsidiaries, Muthoot 
Microfin Limited follow the Straight Line Method for providing depreciation whereas the two other subsidiaries follow 
Written Down Value Method.  
Leasehold improvements and assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of lease term or their useful 
life. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each 
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
Property plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in other income / expense in the statement of profit and loss in the year 
the asset is derecognised. The date of disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the date the recipient obtains 
F 28

control of that item in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in 
Ind AS 115. 
3.14   Capital work-in-progress 
Capital work-in-progress are carried at cost, comprising direct cost and related incidental expenses. Assets which are not 
ready for intended use are also shown under capital work-in-progress. 
3.15    Intangible assets 
The Group’s intangible assets consist of computer software. 
An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the expected future 
economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the Group. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises 
its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use and net of any 
trade discounts and rebates. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised by the Group over a period of 3 years, except in case of Muthoot Pappachan Technologies 
Limited where the computer software is amortised over a period of 10 years or over the estimated useful lives. 
Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. 
3.16   Investment Property 
Properties, held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation are classified as investment property and measured and reported 
at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the assets carrying amount only when it is 
probable that the future economic benefit associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. 
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from 
use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of property 
is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the same period. The fair value of investment property is disclosed in 
the notes accompanying these financial statements. Fair value has been determined by an independent valuer who holds 
a recognised and relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the 
investment property being valued. 
3.17 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Groups assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal 
and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset 
or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining 
fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are considered. If no such transactions can be identified, an 
appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for 
publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the 
assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal 
is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
F 29


# Page 212
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which 
case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. 
3.18 
Post-employment benefits 
3.18.1 Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to the Employees Provident Fund Scheme maintained by the Central Government, Employee State 
Insurance Corporation (ESIC) etc. are accounted for on an accrual basis. Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund 
is a defined contribution scheme.  
The Group has no obligation, other than the contribution payable under the schemes. The Group recognizes contribution 
payable to the provident fund scheme / ESIC as expenditure, when an employee renders the related service. If the 
contribution payable to the scheme / ESIC for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution 
already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. 
If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then 
excess is recognized as an asset. 
3.18.2 
Defined Benefit schemes 
Gratuity 
The Group provides for gratuity covering eligible employees under which a lump sum payment is paid to vested 
employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount reckoned on the respective 
employee’s salary and his tenor of employment with the Group. The Group accounts for its liability for future gratuity 
benefits based on actuarial valuation determined at each Balance Sheet date by an Independent Actuary using Projected 
Unit Credit Method. The Group makes contributions to a Gratuity Fund administered by the Life Insurance Corporation 
of India.  
The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining 
the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan are based on the market yields on Government Securities 
as at the Balance Sheet date.     
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities 
involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. 
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net deﬁned 
beneﬁt liability), are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to other equity 
through OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassiﬁed to statement of proﬁt and loss in 
subsequent periods. 
3.19 
Share Based Payments 
The Group has formulated Employees Stock Option Schemes and Stock Appreciation Right Schemes (SAR). The fair 
value of options granted under Employee Stock Option Plan is recognised as an employee benefits expense with a 
corresponding increase in non-financial liability and the fair value of SAR granted is recognized as an employee benefit 
expense having a corresponding increase in financial liability. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the options. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which 
all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the group revises its estimates of the 
number of options that are expected to vest. 
3.20 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
F 30


# Page 213
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the enterprise determines the level of provision by discounting 
the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific to the liability. The expense relating to any 
provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. 
3.21 
Assets held for sale 
Assets possessed against the settlement of loans are carried in the balance sheet at a value of outstanding principal loan 
amount or fair value of asset whichever is lower. In case the fair value of the asset acquired is lower than the outstanding 
principal loan amount; then the shortfall is to be provided for in the books of account in such financial year. 
These assets are classified as ‘Assets held for sale’ under ‘Non-financial assets’ till the asset acquired is finally disposed. 
The outstanding overdue interest and other charges will be accounted on realization basis.  
Further, if on disposal of the assets so acquired, the sale proceed is higher than the receivable amount (including 
outstanding loan, outstanding overdue interest, other charges and interest), then the excess will be refunded to the 
borrowers. 
3.22 
Taxes 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
3.22.1 Current Tax 
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of taxable profit for a period. Taxable profit differs from 
‘profit before tax’ as reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws.  
Interest income / expenses and penalties, if any, related to income tax are included in current tax expense. The tax rates 
and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of reporting date 
in India where the Group operates and generates taxable income. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either 
in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
3.22.2 Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is probable 
that future taxable amounts will arise to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax assets are reviewed 
at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities are realised 
simultaneously. 
3.22.3 Goods and services tax /value added taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses 
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the goods and services tax/value added taxes paid, except: 
i.
When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in
which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense
item, as applicable
ii.
When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included
The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the balance sheet.

3.23 
Contingent Liabilities and assets 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present 
obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized 
because it cannot be measured reliably. The Group does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in 
the ﬁnancial statements. 
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be conﬁrmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity. The 
Group does not have any contingent assets in the ﬁnancial statements. 
3.24 
Earnings Per Share 
The Group reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic EPS 
is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting preference 
dividend and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity 
shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have been 
issued at a later date. In computing the dilutive earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that 
either reduces the earnings per share or increases loss per share are included. 
3.25 
Dividends on ordinary shares 
The Group recognises a liability to make distributions to equity holders of the Group when the distribution is authorised, 
and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is 
authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. 
3.26 
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement 
and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or 
assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
Group as a lessee 
The Groups lease asset class consists of building, equipment and vehicles. The Group assesses whether a contract contains 
a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group has, at the date of transition, recognized 
a right-of use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less (short term lease) and low value assets. For these short-term and low value leases, 
the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  
The right-of-use assets are recognized at cost, which comprises the present value of the lease liability as at the date of 
transition. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the balance lease term and useful 
life of the underlying asset. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future 
lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit on the lease or, if not readily 
determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates. Interest accrued on lease liability and lease payments made, are 
subsequently adjusted to the initial recognition of lease liability. 
Group as a lessor 
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased 
items are operating leases. Rental Income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the 
lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss. 
3.27 
Cash flow statement 
Cash flows are reported using indirect method, whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions 
of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments and items of income or 
F 32


# Page 215
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from regular revenue generating (operating 
activities), investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. 
3.28 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure 
to foreign exchange rate risk. Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date when a derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each Balance Sheet date and carried as assets when 
their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. The resulting gain/loss is recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and is effective as a hedging instrument, in 
which event the timing of the recognition in the Statement of Profit and Loss depends on the nature of the hedge 
relationship. The Group has designated the derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges of recognized liabilities 
and unrecognized firm commitments. 
3.29 
Hedge Accounting 
In order to manage particular risks, the Group applies hedge accounting for transactions that meet specific criteria. At the 
inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship and the risk 
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective if the 
hedging instrument is offsetting changes in fair value or cashflows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The 
assessment of hedge effectiveness is carried out at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine that the hedging 
relationship has been effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. 
3.30 
Cash Flow Hedges 
A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability (such as all or some future interest payments on variable rate debt) or a highly probable 
forecast transaction and could affect profit and loss. For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion 
of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument is initially recognized directly in Other Comprehensive Income 
(OCI) within equity (cash flow hedging reserve). The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is 
recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. When the hedged cash flow affects the Statement of Profit 
and Loss, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in the corresponding income or 
expense line of the Statement of Profit and Loss. When a hedging instrument is expired, sold, terminated, exercised, or 
when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss that has been recognized in 
OCI at that time remains in OCI and is recognized when the hedged forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss 
that was reported in OCI is immediately transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
4. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the 
accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimates are revised, and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the 
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could 
result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. 
In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognized in the ﬁnancial statements is included in the 
following notes: 
4.1 
Business Model Assessment 
Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The 
Group determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to 
achieve a business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the 
performance of the assets is evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets 
and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Group monitors financial assets 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity 
F 33


# Page 216
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
to understand the reason for their disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for 
which the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Group’s continuous assessment of whether the business model for 
which the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has 
been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the classification of those assets. 
4.2 
Deﬁned employee beneﬁt assets and liabilities 
The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial 
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the 
future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly sensitive to changes 
in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
4.3 
Fair value measurement 
When the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based 
on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using various valuation techniques. The inputs to these 
models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required 
in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. 
Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of ﬁnancial instruments. 
4.4 
Impairment of financial assets 
The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement the estimation of the 
amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when determining impairment losses and the assessment of 
a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by several factors, changes in which can result in different 
levels of allowances. 
It has been the Group’s policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust when 
necessary.  
4.5 
Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method 
The Group’s EIR methodology, recognises interest income / expense using a rate of return that represents the best estimate 
of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of loans given / taken and recognises the effect of potentially 
different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments and 
penalty interest and charges). 
This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and lifecycle of the 
instruments, as well expected changes to India’s base rate and other fee income/expense that are integral parts of the 
instrument. 
4.6 
Lease Term 

The determination of lease term for some lease contracts in which the Group is a lessee, including whether the
Group is reasonably certain to exercise lessee options.

The determination of the incremental borrowing rate used to measure lease liabilities.
4.7 
Share based payments
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation 
model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most 
appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and 
making assumptions about them. 
4.8 
Other estimates 
These include contingent liabilities, useful lives of tangible and intangible assets etc.

including transfer of substantially all risks and rewards relating to assets being transferred to the buyer being met, the assets have been derecognised. The table below summarises the carrying amount of the
derecognised financial assets.
Under previous GAAP, retained interest receivable on loan assignment transactions were recognised over the period of such assigned loans. Under Ind AS, the gain arising on said transactions are recorded
upfront by discounting the future cash flows accruing in the form of differential interest on such assigned loan to their present values. 
The Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer. The Group securitised its mircofinance loans to different entities. These entities are not related to the Group. Also, the Group
neither holds any equity or other interest nor controls them. 
As per the terms of the agreement, the Group is exposed to first loss amounting to 7.25% - 12.5% (7.25% - 12% as at March 31, 2022) of the amount securitised and therefore continues to be exposed to
significant risk and rewards relating to the underlying gold and microfinance loans. These receivables are not derecognised and proceeds received are recorded as a financial liability under borrowings.
The table below outlines the carrying amounts and fair values of all financial assets transferred that are not derecognised in their entirety and associated liabilities.

(vii) The Company had filed a Writ Petition before the Honourable High Court of Madras on 30th July, 2019 challenging the Order passed by the Income Tax Settlement Commission, Chennai Bench
abating the proceedings before it relating to the Settlement Application filed by the Company dated December 17, 2017 (“Settlement Application”); and praying for stay on proceedings initiated by the
Joint Commissioner of Income Tax (OSD), Central Circle, Thiruvananthapuram post abatement of proceedings by the Settlement Commission. The tax and interest due on the issues forming part of the
Settlement Application totaled to ₹ 7,406 lakh. The Settlement Application related to notices received under Section 147 of the Income Tax Act, as per which the income chargeable to tax for the
Financial Years 2011-12 to 2016-17 of MFL has not been assessed, and Section 153A of the Income Tax Act, as per which MFL was required to prepare true and correct return of which MFL was
assessable for the Assessment Years 2011-2012 to 2016-2017. The Honourable High Court of Madras has dismissed the petition filed by the Company on June 29, 2022 on the ground that the cause of
action of the matter has arisen fully in Kerala and not within the territorial jurisdiction of the honourable Madras High Court, thereby ousting its jurisdiction to entertain the petition. Accordingly, the
Company has filed a writ petition before the Honorable High Court of Kerala proceedings of which are ongoing.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most
advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly
observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based
on a hierarchy of valuation techniques.

Particulars
At FVTOCI
As at March 31, 2023
The fair value of financial instruments as referred to above have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the valuation
technique. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The equity instruments which are actively traded on public stock exchanges with readily available active prices on a regular basis are classified as
Level 1. Units held in mutual funds are measured based on their published net asset value (NAV), taking into account redemption and/or other
restrictions are generally Level 1. Equity instruments in non-listed entities are initially recognised at transaction price and re-measured as per fair
valuation report and valued on a case-by-case has been classified as Level 2.
For investment at fair value through profit and loss, valuation are done using quoted prices from active markets or on published Net Asset Values
of the investment at the measurement date or at the nearest available date. 
Investments in Security receipts (SRs) are classified as Financial Assets measured at FVTPL. Since the investment was made in the month of
March 2023 and the investment value approximates the net asset value as at March 31, 2023 as confirmed by the Asset Reconstruction Company
(ARC), disclosure of sensitivity of fair value measurement in unobservable inputs is not considered relevant. 
This level of hierarchy includes financial liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair
values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable
current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data, this level of hierarchy includes cumulative
compulsory convertible preference shares. 
The fair value of the CCCPS is measured using the Monte Carlo Simulation technique. The Monte Carlo Simulation Method is one where a risk-
neutral framework is used to simulate a range of simulated values, representing all the potential paths a variable could move over the period of the
simulation. The inputs to this model are taken from observable market where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is
exercised in establishing fair values. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

 Particulars 
Loan receivables valuation is carried out for two portfolios segregated on the basis of repayment frequency – monthly and weekly. The valuation of
each portfolio is done by discounting the aggregate future cash flows with risk-adjusted discounting rate for the remaining portfolio tenor. 
Following inputs have been used to calculate the fair value of loans receivables:
(i) Future cash flows: Include principal receivable, interest receivable and tenor information based on the repayment schedule agreed with the
borrowers. Inputs include:
(ii) Risk-adjusted discount rate:
This rate has been arrived using the cost of funds approach.

Valuation techniques
Short-term financial assets and liabilities
Loans and advances to customers
Financial liability at amortised cost
For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts, which are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their
fair value. Such instruments include: cash and balances, trade receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents and trade payables without a specific maturity. Amounts have been
classified as Level 3 on the basis that no adjustments have been made to the balances in the balance sheet.
The fair values of loans and receivables are estimated by discounted cash flow models that incorporate assumptions for credit risks, probability of default and loss given default estimates. Since
comparable data is not available, credit risk is derived using historical experience, management view and other information used in its collective impairment models.
The fair values of financial liability held-to-maturity are estimated using a effective interest rate model based on contractual cash flows using actual yields. Since the cost of borrowing on the
reporting date is not expected to be significantly different from the actual yield considered under effective interest rate model, the carrying value of financial liabilities at amortised cost is
considered a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
Set out below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the financial statements. This table does
not include the fair values of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.
Particulars
Level
Carrying Value
Fair Value
Fair values of portfolios are calculated using a portfolio-based approach, grouping loans as far as possible into homogenous groups based on similar characteristics ie, type of loan. The Company
then calculates and extrapolates the fair value to the entire portfolio using Effective interest rate model that incorporate interest rate estimates considering all significant characteristics of the
loans. The credit risk is applied as a top-side adjustment based on the collective impairment model incorporating probability of defaults and loss given defaults. Hence, the carrying amount of
such financial assets at amortised cost net of impairment loss allowance is of reasonable approximation of their fair value.

The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise of borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the Group’s operations. The Group’s principal financial assets
include loans, investments, cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other receivables that derive directly from its operations. 
As a financial lending institution, Group is exposed to various risks that are related to lending business and operating environment. The principal objective in Group's risk management processes is to measure and monitor the various
risks that Group is subject to and to follow policies and procedures to address such risks. 
The Groups Risk Management Committee (RMC) comprise of the Board of directors constituted in accordance with the RBI rules. The RMC has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Risk Management Policy.
The committee meets on a quarterly basis to review the risk management practices and working of the risk management department. The committee is chaired by an Independent Director. Risk Management Department periodically
places its report to the committee for review. The committee’s suggestions for improving the risk management practices are implemented by the Risk Management Department.  
The Group has implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to assess, monitor and manage risk throughout the Group. The risk management process is continuously reviewed, improved and adapted in the changing risk
scenario and the agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the changing risk landscape. The process of continuous evaluation of risks includes taking stock of the risk landscape on an
event-driven basis. The Group has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically adressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis.
The major type of risk Group faces in business are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk.
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group’s major income generating activity is gold loan, housing loan, microfinance loan 
personal loans and others.
The Group addressess credit risk through following major processess:
- Standardize the process of identifying new risks and designing appropriate controls for these risks
- Minimize losses due to defaults or untimely payments by borrowers
- Maintain an appropriate credit administration and loan review system 
- Establish metrics for portfolio monitoring
- Design appropriate credit risk mitigation techniques
- Structured and standardised credit approval process
- Verification of credit history from credit bureau agencies, personal verification of customers business and  residence
- Technical and Legal Verification
- Comprehensive credit risk assessment and cash flow analysis
In order to mitigate the impact of credit risk in the future profitability, the Company makes reserves basis the expected credit loss (ECL model) for the outstanding loans.
The Group’s impairment assessment and measurement approach is set out in this note. It should be read in conjunction with the Summary of significant accounting policies.
The Group considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.
As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Group also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such events occur, the Group carefully considers whether the event
should result in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate.
The Group considers a financial instrument as 'cured' and therefore re-classified out of Stage 3 during the year only once the entire dues have been received.

LGD Rates have been computed internally based on the discounted recoveries in NPA accounts that are closed/ written off/ repossessed and upgraded during the year. 
Significant Increase in credit risk
II) Liquidity risk
 Asset Liability Management (ALM)
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group may not meet its financial obligations. Liquidity risk arises due to the unavailability of adequate funds at an appropriate cost or tenure. The objective of liquidity risk management, is to 
maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Group consistently generates sufficient cash flows from operating and financial activities to meet its financial obligations as and when they 
fall due.  Our treasury team sources funds from multiple sources, including from banks, financial institutions, capital & retail markets to maintain a healthy mix of sources. They are responsible for diversifying fund raising sources, 
managing interest rate risks and maintaining a strong relationship with banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies, other domestic and foreign financial institutions and rating agencies to ensure the liquidity risk is 
well addressed.
The outstanding balance as at the reporting date is considered as EAD by the Group.
The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. To calculate the ECL for a Stage 1 loan, the Group assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the calculation of the 12
month ECL. For Stage 2 and Stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the instruments. The Group uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the
different products and schemes, the Group has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental 90 day DPD approach considering fresh slippage using historical information. 
Based on its review of macro-economic developments and economic outlook, the Group has assessed that no adjustment is required for temporary overlays to determine qualitative impact on its PD's as at 31st March 2023 and 31st
March 2022.
The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive.
When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Group applies the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
The internal rating model evaluates the loans on an ongoing basis. The rating model also assesses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the previously assigned risk grade. One key factor that indicates significant 
increase in credit risk is when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.

III) Market risk
Interest rate risk
Market Risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market factor. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the interest
rates and other market changes. The Group is exposed to two types of market risk as follows:
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group is  subject to interest rate risk, principally because we lend to clients at fixed interest 
rates and for periods that may differ from our funding sources, while our borrowings are at both fixed and variable interest rates for different periods.  We assess and manage our interest rate risk by managing our assets and liabilities. 
Our Asset Liability Management Committee evaluates asset liability management, and ensures that all significant mismatches, if any, are being managed appropriately.

Prepayment risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Group will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment earlier or later than expected.
Operational and business risk
<This section has been  intentionally left blank>
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to operate effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or
lead to financial loss. The Group cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but it endeavours to manage these risks through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include effective
segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, such as the use of internal audit.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion of  borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the profit before taxes affected through the impact on 
floating rate borrowings, debt securities and subordinate laibilities are as follows:
Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decreases as the result of changes in level of equity indices and individual stocks.  The trading and non-trading equity price risk  exposure arises from equity securities classified 
at FVTPL and FVOCI respectively”.
A 10% increase/(decrease) in the equity price (traded and non-traded) would have the impact as follows:

Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Management is satisfied that the Group shall be 
able to continue its business for the foreseeable future and no material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt 
on the going concern assumption. 
2.2 Presentation of financial Statements 
The Group presents its Balance Sheet in order of liquidity.  The Group prepares and presents its Balance Sheet, the 
Statement of Profit and Loss and the Statement of Changes in Equity in the format prescribed by Division III of Schedule 
III to the Act. The Statement of Cash Flows has been prepared and presented as per the requirements of Ind AS 7 
‘Statement of Cash Flows’. 
The Group generally reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis in the Balance Sheet. They are offset 
and reported net only when Ind AS specifically permits the same or it has an unconditional legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event. Similarly, the Group offsets incomes and 
expenses and reports the same on a net basis when permitted by Ind AS specifically unless they are material in nature. 
2.3 Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Company and all its subsidiaries, 
being the entities that it controls from the date control is gained. Control is evidenced where the investor is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the investee. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, 
which significantly affect the entity’s returns. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting 
year as the Parent Company. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align 
the accounting policies in line with accounting policies of the Parent Company. 
These consolidated financial statements are prepared on the following basis in accordance with Ind AS 110 on 
“Consolidated Financial Statements” specified under Section 133 of the Act. Following subsidiary companies have been 
considered in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 
i)
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through
its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the date on which controls commences until the date on which control ceases.
ii)
Non-controlling interest (“NCI”)
NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.
Changes in the Group’s equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as
equity transactions.
iii)
Loss of control
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and
any related NCI and other component of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at
fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit and
loss.

iv) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
The financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary used in the consolidation procedure are
drawn up to the same reporting date i.e. March 31, 2022. The financial statements of the Holding Company and
its subsidiary are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Intra-group balances and transactions, and unrealized income and expenses
arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as
unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. The Group follows uniform
accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. For additional information as
required by Paragraph 2 of the General Instructions for preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements to
Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, refer Note 49.
2.4 
Basis of measurement 
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for following assets and liabilities which 
have been measured at fair value: 
i)
Investments in equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
ii)
Financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
iii)
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
iv)
Investments which are held for trading
v)
Defined benefit plans.
2.5 
Functional and presentation currency 
The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR) which is also functional currency of the Group and the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. All values are rounded to the nearest lakhs, 
except when otherwise indicated.  
3.
Significant accounting policies
3.1 
Recognition of interest income
Interest income is recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial 
assets other than credit-impaired assets and financial assets classified as measured at FVTPL. 
 The EIR in case of a financial asset is computed  
a.
As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to
the gross carrying amount of a financial asset.
b.
By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.
c.
Including all fees received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate,
transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.
Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets. 
3.2 .  Recognition of revenue from sale of goods and services 
Revenue (other than for financial instruments) is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Ind 
AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers outlines a single comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising 
from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance found within Ind ASs. 
The Group recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in Ind 115: 
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that 
creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met. 
Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a 
customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. 
F 116


# Page 299
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects 
to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties. 
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than 
one performance obligation, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that 
depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance 
obligation. 
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation 
Revenue from contract with customer for rendering services is recognised at a point in time when performance obligation 
is satisfied. 
3.2.1 
Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and the amount of the dividend can be measured 
reliably. 
3.2.2 
Rental Income 
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included 
in rental income in the statement of profit and loss, unless the increase is in line with expected general inflation, in which 
case lease income is recognised based on contractual terms. 
3.2.3 
Fees and commission income 
Fees and commission income such as service charges, commission from fee-based business lines, service income etc. are 
recognised on point in time basis. 
3.2.4 
Miscellaneous Income 
All other income is recognized on an accrual basis, when there is no uncertainty in the ultimate realization/collection. 
3.3 
Financial instruments  
A.
Financial Asset
3.3.1 
Initial recognition 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Loans are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account. Investments are recognised on the date when 
the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions. The Group recognises debt securities, deposits and borrowings 
when funds reach the Group and post allotment, where applicable. 
3.3.2 Initial and subsequent measurement of financial instruments 
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: 
1.
Debt instruments at amortised cost
2.
Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).
3.
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
4.
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI.
The classification depends on the contractual terms of the financial assets’ cash flows and the Group’s business model 
for managing financial assets which are explained below: 
Business model assessment 
The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to 
achieve its business objective. 
The Group's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated 
portfolios and is based on observable factors such as: 
F 117


# Page 300
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
► How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated
and reported to the entity's key management personnel
► The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model)
and the way those risks are managed
► How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of
the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected)
► The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Group’s assessment.
► The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ 
scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group's
original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that
business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial
assets going forward.
The SPPI test 
As a second step of its classification process, the Group assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify 
whether they meet the SPPI test. 
‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may 
change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the 
premium/discount). 
In making this assessment, the Group considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending 
arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks 
and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure 
to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through the 
profit and loss account or is required to measure liabilities at fair value through profit or loss such as derivative liabilities. 
3.3.3 Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect
contractual cash flows and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement at fair value plus directly attributable costs, these financial assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by considering any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in 
interest income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in statement of profit and loss. 
3.3.4 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both the following conditions are 
met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect
contractual cash flows and selling the assets and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding
Debt instruments included within the FVOCI category are measured at each reporting date at fair value with such changes 
being recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI). The interest income on these assets is recognised in profit or 
loss. Impairment losses or reversals, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit and 
loss. Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified 
from equity to the income statement.  
F 118

Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
3.3.5 Financial Instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified 
as at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments that meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria but are designated 
as at FVTPL are measured at FVTPL. 
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVOCI criteria may be designated 
as at FVTPL upon initial recognition, if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition 
inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different 
bases. 
Group’s investment is classified as FVTPL, if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or 
repurchasing in the near term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for 
which there is evidence of short-term profit taking. 
Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value, with transaction costs 
recognised in the income statement as incurred. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value and any gains or losses are 
recognised in the income statement as they arise.  
3.3.6 Equity instruments 
The Group subsequently measures investment in equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, unless the Group’s 
management has elected to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI, when 
such instruments meet the definition of definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are 
not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Gains and losses on these equity instruments classified at FVOCI are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognised in profit or loss as dividend income when the right of the payment has been established, except when the 
Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are 
recorded in OCI.  
B. Financial Liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement 
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or the issue of financial liability, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are adjusted to fair value at initial 
recognition. 
Subsequent measurement  
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
3.4 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
3.4.1 
Financial Asset 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Group also derecognises 
the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.  
The Group has transferred the financial asset if, and only if, either: 
a)
The Group has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset
or
b)
It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full
without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass–through’ arrangement
Pass-through arrangements are transactions whereby the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows 
of a financial asset (the 'original asset'), but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more 
entities (the 'eventual recipients'), when all of the following three conditions are met: 
► The Group has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it has collected equivalent amounts
from the original asset, excluding short-term advances with the right to full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued
interest at market rates
F 119

Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
► The Group cannot sell or pledge the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients
► The Group has to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay. In
addition, the Group is not entitled to reinvest such cash flows, except for investments in cash or cash equivalents
including interest earned, during the period between the collection date and the date of required remittance to the
eventual recipients.
A transfer only qualifies for derecognition if either: 
► The Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset
or
► The Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset
The Group considers control to be transferred if and only if, the transferee has the practical ability to sell the asset in 
its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without imposing additional 
restrictions on the transfer. 
When the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and has retained control of 
the asset, the asset continues to be recognised only to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement, in which case, 
the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a 
basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained. 
3.4.2 Financial Liability 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as de recognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability 
and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. 
3.5 Offsetting 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities 
are offset, and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and 
intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously in all the following 
circumstances: 
a.
The normal course of business
b.
The event of default
c.
The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group and/or its counter parties.
3.6 Impairment of financial assets 
3.6.1 
Overview of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) principles 
The Group has created provisions on all financial assets except for financial assets classified as FVTPL, based on the 
expected credit loss method. The Group also ensures maintaining the minimum provision requirement as per RBI and 
NHB regulations. 
The ECL provision is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit 
loss), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based 
on the 12 months’ expected credit loss. The 12-month ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs that 
result from default events on financial assets that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. 
The Group performs an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk 
has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the 
remaining life of the financial instrument. 
Based on the above process, the Group categorises its loans into three stages as described below: 
F 120


# Page 303
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
For non-impaired financial instruments 

Stage 1 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have not experienced a significant increase
in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. A 12-month ECL provision is made for stage 1 financial
instruments. In assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Group compares the risk of a default
occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date, with the risk of a default occurring on the financial
instrument as at the date of initial recognition.

Stage 2 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have experienced a SICR since initial
recognition. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for stage 2 financial instruments. In subsequent reporting
periods, if the credit risk of the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a SICR since initial
recognition, then entities recognize 12 months of ECL.
For impaired financial instruments: 
Financial instruments are classified as stage 3 when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more 
loss events that have occurred after initial recognition with a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows of a loan 
or a portfolio of loans. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for impaired financial instruments. 
3.6.2 
The calculation of ECLs 
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows: 
Probability of Default (PD) - The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time 
horizon. 
The Group uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products and schemes, 
the Group has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach 
considering fresh slippage using historical information.  
Exposure at Default (EAD) - The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering 
expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether 
scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed 
payments.  
Loss Given Default (LGD) – The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs 
at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect 
to receive.  
Forward looking information 
While estimating the expected credit losses, the Group reviews macro-economic developments occurring in the economy 
and market it operates in. On a periodic basis, the Group analyses if there is any relationship between key economic 
trends like GDP, unemployment rates, benchmark rates set by the Reserve Bank of India, inﬂation etc. with the estimate 
of PD, LGD determined by the Group based on its internal data. While the internal estimates of PD, LGD rates by the 
Group may not be always reﬂective of such relationships, temporary overlays, if any, are embedded in the methodology 
to reﬂect such macro-economic trends reasonably. 
Write-offs 
Loans are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case 
when it is determined that the customer does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufﬁcient cash 
ﬂows to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are credited to the 
statement of proﬁt and loss. 
Collateral 
To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Group seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in 
various forms, such as gold, cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, stock, current asset etc. However, the fair value 
of collateral affects the calculation of ECLs. The fair value of the same is based on data provided by third party or 
management judgements.

Impairment of Trade receivables 
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The Group 
uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix 
is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables. 
3.7 Determination of fair value 
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, investments at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
i.
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
ii.
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability, if market participants act in their economic best interest. 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits 
by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use. 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which enough data are available 
to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
The financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as summarised below: 
Level 1 financial instruments − Those where the inputs used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group has access to at the measurement date. The Group considers 
markets as active only if there are sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical 
assets or liabilities and when there are binding and exercisable price quotes available on the balance sheet date. 
Level 2 financial instruments − Those where the inputs that are used for valuation and are significant, are derived from 
directly or indirectly observable market data available over the entire period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include 
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets 
and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit 
spreads. In addition, adjustments may be required for the condition or location of the asset or the extent to which it relates 
to items that are comparable to the valued instrument. However, if such adjustments are based on unobservable inputs 
which are significant to the entire measurement, the Group will classify the instruments as Level 3. 
Level 3 financial instruments − Those that include one or more unobservable input that is signiﬁcant to the measurement 
as whole. 
3.8 Foreign Currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the spot rate of ex-change ruling at 
the date of the transaction. However, for practical reasons, the Group uses an average rate if the average approximates 
the actual rate at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot 
rate of exchange at the reporting date. All differences arising on non–trading activities are taken to other income/expense 
in the statement of profit and loss.  
Non–monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange 
rates as at the date of recognition. 
3.9 Finance cost 
Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying 
amount of financial liabilities other than financial liabilities classified as FVTPL. 
F 122


# Page 305
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognized as part of the carrying value of the financial liability 
and amortized over the expected life using the effective interest method. These include fees and commissions payable 
to advisers and other expenses such as external legal costs, provided these are incremental costs that are directly related 
to the issue of a financial liability. 
3.10 Other income and expenses  
All Other income and expense are recognized in the period they occur. 
3.11  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand, short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less and forex balances, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short- term deposits, as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts, if any as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management. 
3.12   Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, 
(if any). The total cost of assets comprises its purchase price, freight, duties, taxes and any other incidental expenses 
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by the management.  
Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, 
and treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible asset are added to its gross value only if it increases the future 
benefits of the existing asset, beyond its previously assessed standards of performance and cost can be measured reliably. 
Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed off as and when incurred. 
3.13 Depreciation 
Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost comprises the purchase price and any 
attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.  
Depreciation is charged based on a review by the management during the year and at the rates derived based on the useful 
lives of the assets as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 or estimated useful lives estimated by the 
respective management based on technical evaluation. The holding company and one of its subsidiaries, Muthoot 
Microfin Limited follow the Straight Line Method for providing depreciation whereas the two other subsidiaries follow 
Written Down Value Method.  
Leasehold improvements and assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of lease term or their useful 
life. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each 
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
Property plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in other income / expense in the statement of profit and loss in the year 
the asset is derecognised. The date of disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the date the recipient obtains 
control of that item in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in 
Ind AS 115. 
3.14   Capital work-in-progress 
Capital work-in-progress are carried at cost, comprising direct cost and related incidental expenses. Assets which are not 
ready for intended use are also shown under capital work-in-progress. 
3.15    Intangible assets 
The Group’s intangible assets consist of computer software. 
F 123


# Page 306
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the expected future 
economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the Group. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises 
its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use and net of any 
trade discounts and rebates. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised by the Group over a period of 3 years, except in case of Muthoot Pappachan Technologies 
Limited where the computer software is amortised over a period of 10 years or over the estimated useful lives. 
Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. 
3.16   Investment Property 
Properties, held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation are classified as investment property and measured and reported 
at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the assets carrying amount only when it is 
probable that the future economic benefit associated with the expenditure will flow to the company. 
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from 
use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of property 
is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the same period. 
3.17 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Groups assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal 
and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset 
or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining 
fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are considered. If no such transactions can be identified, an 
appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for 
publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the 
assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal 
is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which 
case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. 
3.18 
Post-employment benefits 
3.18.1 Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to the Employees Provident Fund Scheme maintained by the Central Government, Employee State 
Insurance Corporation (ESIC) etc. are accounted for on an accrual basis. Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund 
is a defined contribution scheme.  
The Group has no obligation, other than the contribution payable under the schemes. The Group recognizes contribution 
payable to the provident fund scheme / ESIC as expenditure, when an employee renders the related service. If the 
contribution payable to the scheme / ESIC for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution 
already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. 
F 124


# Page 307
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then 
excess is recognized as an asset. 
3.18.2 
Defined Benefit schemes 
Gratuity 
The Group provides for gratuity covering eligible employees under which a lump sum payment is paid to vested 
employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount reckoned on the respective 
employee’s salary and his tenor of employment with the Group. The Group accounts for its liability for future gratuity 
benefits based on actuarial valuation determined at each Balance Sheet date by an Independent Actuary using Projected 
Unit Credit Method. The Group makes contributions to a Gratuity Fund administered by the Life Insurance Corporation 
of India.  
The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining 
the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan are based on the market yields on Government Securities 
as at the Balance Sheet date.     
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities 
involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. 
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net deﬁned 
beneﬁt liability), are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to other equity 
through OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassiﬁed to statement of proﬁt and loss in 
subsequent periods. 
3.19 
Share Based Payments 
The Group has formulated an Employees Stock Option Scheme to be administered through respective Trusts for its 
subsidiaries MML and MHFCL. The fair value of options granted under Employee Stock Option Plan is recognised as 
an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in other equity. The total amount to be expensed is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the options. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is 
the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the estimates 
of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting and service conditions are revised. It 
recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in Statement of Profit and Loss, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity. 
3.20 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the enterprise determines the level of provision by discounting 
the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific to the liability. The expense relating to any 
provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. 
3.21 
Assets held for sale 
Assets possessed against the settlement of loans are carried in the balance sheet at a value of outstanding principal loan 
amount or fair value of asset whichever is lower. In case the fair value of the asset acquired is lower than the outstanding 
principal loan amount; then the shortfall is to be provided for in the books of account in such financial year. 
These assets are classified as ‘Assets held for sale’ under ‘Non-financial assets’ till the asset acquired is finally disposed. 
The outstanding overdue interest and other charges will be accounted on realization basis.  
Further, if on disposal of the assets so acquired, the sale proceed is higher than the receivable amount (including 
outstanding loan, outstanding overdue interest, other charges and interest), then the Company will refund the excess 
amount to the borrowers.

3.22 
Taxes 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
3.21.1 Current Tax 
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of taxable profit for a period. Taxable profit differs from 
‘profit before tax’ as reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws.  
Interest income / expenses and penalties, if any, related to income tax are included in current tax expense. The tax rates 
and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of reporting date 
in India where the Group operates and generates taxable income. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either 
in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
3.22.2 Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is probable 
that future taxable amounts will arise to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax assets are reviewed 
at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities are realised 
simultaneously. 
3.22.3 Goods and services tax /value added taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses 
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the goods and services tax/value added taxes paid, except: 
i.
When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in
which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense
item, as applicable
ii.
When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included
The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the balance sheet. 
3.23 
Contingent Liabilities and assets 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present 
obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized 
because it cannot be measured reliably. The Group does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in 
the ﬁnancial statements. 
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be conﬁrmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity. The 
Group does not have any contingent assets in the ﬁnancial statements.

3.24 
Earnings Per Share 
The Group reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic EPS 
is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting preference 
dividend and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity 
shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have been 
issued at a later date. In computing the dilutive earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that 
either reduces the earnings per share or increases loss per share are included. 
3.25 
Dividends on ordinary shares 
The Group recognises a liability to make distributions to equity holders of the Group when the distribution is authorised, 
and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is 
authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. 
3.26 
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement 
and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or 
assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
Group as a lessee 
The Groups lease asset class consists of building, equipment and vehicles. The Group assesses whether a contract contains 
a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group has, at the date of transition, recognized 
a right-of use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less (short term lease) and low value assets. For these short-term and low value leases, 
the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  
The right-of-use assets are recognized at cost, which comprises the present value of the lease liability as at the date of 
transition. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the balance lease term and useful 
life of the underlying asset. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future 
lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit on the lease or, if not readily 
determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates. Interest accrued on lease liability and lease payments made, are 
subsequently adjusted to the initial recognition of lease liability. 
Group as a lessor 
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased 
items are operating leases. Rental Income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the 
lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss. 
3.27 
Cash flow statement 
Cash flows are reported using indirect method, whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions 
of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments and items of income or 
expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from regular revenue generating (operating 
activities), investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. 
4. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the 
accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimates are revised, and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the 
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could 
result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods.

In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognized in the ﬁnancial statements is included in the 
following notes: 
4.1 
Business Model Assessment 
Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The 
Group determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to 
achieve a business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the 
performance of the assets is evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets 
and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Group monitors financial assets 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity 
to understand the reason for their disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for 
which the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Group’s continuous assessment of whether the business model for 
which the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has 
been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the classification of those assets. 
4.2 
Deﬁned employee beneﬁt assets and liabilities 
The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial 
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the 
future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly sensitive to changes 
in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
4.3 
Fair value measurement 
When the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based 
on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using various valuation techniques. The inputs to these 
models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required 
in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. 
Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of ﬁnancial instruments. 
4.4 
Impairment of financial assets 
The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement the estimation of the 
amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when determining impairment losses and the assessment of 
a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by several factors, changes in which can result in different 
levels of allowances. 
It has been the Group’s policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust when 
necessary.  
4.5 
Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method 
The Group’s EIR methodology, recognises interest income / expense using a rate of return that represents the best estimate 
of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of loans given / taken and recognises the effect of potentially 
different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments and 
penalty interest and charges). 
This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and lifecycle of the 
instruments, as well expected changes to India’s base rate and other fee income/expense that are integral parts of the 
instrument. 
4.6 
Lease Term 

The determination of lease term for some lease contracts in which the Company is a lessee, including whether the
Company is reasonably certain to exercise lessee options.

The determination of the incremental borrowing rate used to measure lease liabilities.
4.7 
Share based payments
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation 
model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most

The carrying amount of above assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
<This section has been  intentionally left blank>
The Group has sold some loans and advances as a source of finance. As per terms of the deal, risk and reward has been transferred to the customer. Hence, as per the derecognition criteria of IND AS 109,
including transfer of substantially all risks and rewards relating to assets being transferred to the buyer being met, the assets have been derecognised. The table below summarises the carrying amount of the
derecognised financial assets.
Under previous GAAP, retained interest receivable on loan assignment transactions were recognised over the period of such assigned loans. Under Ind AS, the gain arising on said transactions are recorded
upfront by discounting the future cash flows accruing in the form of differential interest on such assigned loan to their present values. 
The Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer. The Group securitised its mircofinance loans to different entities. These entities are not related to the Group. Also, the Group
neither holds any equity or other interest nor controls them. 
As per the terms of the agreement, the Group is exposed to first loss amounting to 7.25% - 12% (7.25% - 10% as at March 31, 2021) of the amount securitised and therefore continues to be exposed to significant
risk and rewards relating to the underlying gold and microfinance loans. These receivables are not derecognised and proceeds received are recorded as a financial liability under borrowings.
The table below outlines the carrying amounts and fair values of all financial assets transferred that are not derecognised in their entirety and associated liabilities.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most
advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly
observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based
on a hierarchy of valuation techniques.

Particulars
At FVTOCI
As at March 31, 2022
The fair value of financial instruments as referred to above have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the valuation
technique. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The equity instruments which are actively traded on public stock exchanges with readily available active prices on a regular basis are classified as
Level 1. Units held in mutual funds are measured based on their published net asset value (NAV), taking into account redemption and/or other
restrictions are generally Level 1. Equity instruments in non-listed entities are initially recognised at transaction price and re-measured as per fair
valuation report and valued on a case-by-case has been classified as Level 2.
For investment at fair value through profit and loss, valuation are done using quoted prices from active markets or on published Net Asset Values
of the investment at the measurement date or at the nearest available date. 
This level of hierarchy includes financial liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair
values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable
current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data, this level of hierarchy includes cumulative
compulsory convertible preference shares. 
The fair value of the CCCPS is measured using the Monte Carlo Simulation technique. The Monte Carlo Simulation Method is one where a risk-
neutral framework is used to simulate a range of simulated values, representing all the potential paths a variable could move over the period of the
simulation. The inputs to this model are taken from observable market where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is
exercised in establishing fair values. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

 Particulars 
Loan receivables valuation is carried out for two portfolios segregated on the basis of repayment frequency – monthly and weekly. The valuation
of each portfolio is done by discounting the aggregate future cash flows with risk-adjusted discounting rate for the remaining portfolio tenor. 
Following inputs have been used to calculate the fair value of loans receivables:
(i) Future cash flows: Include principal receivable, interest receivable and tenor information based on the repayment schedule agreed with the
borrowers. Inputs include:
(ii) Risk-adjusted discount rate:
This rate has been arrived using the cost of funds approach.

fair value. Such instruments include: cash and balances, Trade receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents and trade payables without a specific maturity. Such amounts have been
classified as Level 3 on the basis that no adjustments have been made to the balances in the balance sheet.
The fair values of loans and receivables are estimated by discounted cash flow models that incorporate assumptions for credit risks, probability of default and loss given default estimates. Since
comparable data is not available, credit risk is derived using historical experience, management view and other information used in its collective impairment models.
The fair values of financial liability held-to-maturity are estimated using a effective interest rate model based on contractual cash flows using actual yields. Since the cost of borrowing on the
reporting date is not expected to be significantly different from the actual yield considered under effective interest rate model, the carrying value of financial liabilities at amortised cost is
considered a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
Set out below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the financial statements. This table does
not include the fair values of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.

Carrying Value
Fair Value
Fair values of portfolios are calculated using a portfolio-based approach, grouping loans as far as possible into homogenous groups based on similar characteristics ie, type of loan. The Company
then calculates and extrapolates the fair value to the entire portfolio using Effective interest rate model that incorporate interest rate estimates considering all significant characteristics of the
loans. The credit risk is applied as a top-side adjustment based on the collective impairment model incorporating probability of defaults and loss given defaults. Hence, the carrying amount of
such financial assets at amortised cost net of impairment loss allowance is of reasonable approximation of their fair value.

The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise of borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the Group’s operations. The Group’s principal financial assets
include loans, investments, cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other receivables that derive directly from its operations. 
As a financial lending institution, Group is exposed to various risks that are related to lending business and operating environment. The principal objective in Group's risk management processes is to measure and monitor the various
risks that Group is subject to and to follow policies and procedures to address such risks. 
The Groups Risk Management Committee (RMC) comprise of the Board of directors constituted in accordance with the RBI rules. The RMC has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Risk Management Policy.
The committee meets on a quarterly basis to review the risk management practices and working of the risk management department. The committee is chaired by an Independent Director. Risk Management Department periodically
places its report to the committee for review. The committee’s suggestions for improving the risk management practices are implemented by the Risk Management Department.  
The Group has implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to assess, monitor and manage risk throughout the Group. The risk management process is continuously reviewed, improved and adapted in the changing risk
scenario and the agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the changing risk landscape. The process of continuous evaluation of risks includes taking stock of the risk landscape on an
event-driven basis. The Group has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically adressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis.
The major type of risk Group faces in business are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk.
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group’s major income generating activity is gold loan, housing loan, microfinance loan 
personal loans and others.
The Group addressess credit risk through following major processess:
- Standardize the process of identifying new risks and designing appropriate controls for these risks
- Minimize losses due to defaults or untimely payments by borrowers
- Maintain an appropriate credit administration and loan review system 
- Establish metrics for portfolio monitoring
- Design appropriate credit risk mitigation techniques
- Structured and standardised credit approval process
- Verification of credit history from credit bureau agencies, personal verification of customers business and  residence
- Technical and Legal Verification
- Comprehensive credit risk assessment and cash flow analysis
In order to mitigate the impact of credit risk in the future profitability, the Company makes reserves basis the expected credit loss (ECL model) for the outstanding loans.
The Group’s impairment assessment and measurement approach is set out in this note. It should be read in conjunction with the Summary of significant accounting policies.
The Group considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.
As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Group also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such events occur, the Group carefully considers whether the event
should result in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate.
It is the Group’s policy to consider a financial instrument as ‘cured’ and therefore re-classified out of Stage 3 when none of the default criteria have been present for at least three consecutive months. The decision whether to classify an
asset as Stage 2 or Stage 1 once cured depends on the updated credit grade, at the time of the cure, and whether this indicates there has been a significant increase in credit risk compared to initial recognition.

Significant Increase in credit risk
II) Liquidity risk
 Asset Liability Management (ALM)
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group may not meet its financial obligations. Liquidity risk arises due to the unavailability of adequate funds at an appropriate cost or tenure. The objective of liquidity risk management, is to 
maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Group consistently generates sufficient cash flows from operating and financial activities to meet its financial obligations as and when they 
fall due.  Our resource mobilisation team sources funds from multiple sources, including from banks, financial institutions, capital & retail markets to maintain a healthy mix of sources. The resource mobilisation team is responsible for 
diversifying fund raising sources, managing interest rate risks and maintaining a strong relationship with banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies, other domestic and foreign financial institutions and rating 
agencies to ensure the liquidity risk is well addressed.
The outstanding balance as at the reporting date is considered as EAD by the Group.
The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. To calculate the ECL for a Stage 1 loan, the Group assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the calculation of the 12
month ECL. For Stage 2 and Stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the instruments. The Group uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the
different products and schemes, the Group has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental 90 day DPD approach considering fresh slippage using historical information. 
Based on its review of macro-economic developments and economic outlook, the Group has assessed that no adjustment is required for temporary overlays to determine qualitative impact on its PD's as at 31st March 2022 and 31st
March 2021.
The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive.
When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Group applies the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
The internal rating model evaluates the loans on an ongoing basis. The rating model also assesses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the previously assigned risk grade. One key factor that indicates significant 
increase in credit risk is when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.

III) Market risk
Interest rate risk
Market Risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market factor. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the interest
rates and other market changes. The Group is exposed to two types of market risk as follows:
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group is  subject to interest rate risk, principally because we lend to clients at fixed interest 
rates and for periods that may differ from our funding sources, while our borrowings are at both fixed and variable interest rates for different periods.  We assess and manage our interest rate risk by managing our assets and liabilities. 
Our Asset Liability Management Committee evaluates asset liability management, and ensures that all significant mismatches, if any, are being managed appropriately.

Prepayment risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Group will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment earlier or later than expected.
Operational and business risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to operate effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or
lead to financial loss. The Group cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but it endeavours to manage these risks through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include effective
segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, such as the use of internal audit.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion of  borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the profit before taxes affected through the impact on 
floating rate borrowings, debt securities and subordinate laibilities are as follows:
Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decreases as the result of changes in level of equity indices and individual stocks.  The trading and non-trading equity price risk  exposure arises from equity securities classified 
at FVTPL and FVOCI respectively”.
A 10% increase/(decrease) in the equity price (traded and non-traded) would have the impact as follows:

44 Impact of Covid-19
The after effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant restrictions have continued to have its impact on economic activity during the year ended March 31, 2022. However, this has not resulted in a significant impact on the
operations / financial position of the Group, though there has been an expected level of stress in collections and higher gold auctions during the year. 
The Group continues to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its liquidity and ability to repay its obligations as and when they fall due and the management believes that the Group will be able to pay its obligations as and
when these become due in the foreseeable future. The Group would continue to focus on maintaining adequate capital and ensuring liquidity at all points in time. The Group has recorded a management overlay allowance of INR
4,796.75 (P.Y. INR 4,613.89) in its Expected Credit Loss provision in view of the circumstances following the pandemic, based on the information available at this time.

Information other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report thereon 
The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The 
other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not 
include the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements, Standalone Ind AS Financial 
Statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Annual Report is expected to be made 
available to us after the date of this auditor's report. 
Our opinion on the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements does not cover the other 
information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information, compare with the financial statements of the 
subsidiaries audited by the other auditors, to the extent lt relates to this entity and, in doing 
so, place reliance on the work of the other auditors and consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Ind AS FinanciaJ Statements 
or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. Other information so far as it relates to subsidiary companies, is 
traced from their financial statements audited by the other auditors. 
When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance. 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements 
The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 
134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these Consolidated 
Ind AS Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and 
consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles 
generalJy accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under section 
133 of the Act. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group 
are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing and 
'detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
4

# Page 372
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that 
were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give 
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. 
In preparing the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements, the respective Board of 
Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing the Group's 
ability to continue as a going concern, disdosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management either 
intends to liquidate or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are also 
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group. 
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Ind AS 
Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit We also: 
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that js sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the
Companies Act, 2013, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the
Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the
operating effectiveness of such controls.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management
- • Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
5 
F 190


# Page 373
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are requir.ed to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the 
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor's report However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
continue as a going concern. 
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Ind AS
Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Ind AS
Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the audit of the financial statements of such entities or business activities included in the
consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the
subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by
other auditors, such other auditor shall remain responsible for the direction, supervision
and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our
audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Consolidated Ind AS Financial 
Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements may 
be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and to evaluate the effect 
of any identified misstatements in the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements. 
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during 
our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied 
with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with 
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial 
Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about 
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because of the adverse consequences of doing so would 
b_e.re sonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure A to Independent Auditors' Report 
Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under 'Report on other legal and regulatory 
requirements' of the Independent Auditors' Report of even date to the members of 
Muthoot Fincorp Limited on the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements as of and 
for the year ended March 31, 2021 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) 
of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2 013 ("the Act"): 
In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements of the
Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021, we have audited the internal
financial controls over financial reporting of Muthoot Fincorp Limited (hereinafter
referred to as "the Holding Company') and its subsidiary companies, which includes
internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies,
are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the
internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the respective Companies
considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on
Audit of lnternal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of r ndia. These responsibilities include the design, implementation
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the
respective company's policies, the safeguardjng of its assets, the prevention and detection
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act,
2013. 
Audi tors' Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls over financiaJ
reporting of the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies, based on our audit We
conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial
Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing,
both issued by the ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the
Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate
internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if
such controls operated effectively in all material respects. 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of
the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating
efrettil �eness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included
C, �b�' �j an understanding of internal fl nan c;al con tro!s over fl na ncial reporting, assessing
'"r�d Ac.c.o� 
F 194


# Page 377
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating �ffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by 
the other auditors of the subsidiary companies are sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion on the Group's internal financial controls system over financial 
reporting. 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial 
reporting includes those policies and procedures that; (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting princip]es, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acqujsition, use, or disposition of 
the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal .financial controls over financial reporting, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial 
reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Opinion 
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us 
and based on the consideration of tbe reports of the other auditors referred to in the Other 
Matters paragraph below, the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies, have, in all 
material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting 
and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as 
at March 31, 2021, based on the criteria for internal financial control over financial 
reporting established by the respective companies considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the r nstitute of Chartered Accountants of India.

able to continue its business for the foreseeable future and no material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt 
on the going concern assumption. 
2.2 Presentation of financial Statements 
The Group presents its Balance Sheet in order of liquidity.  The Group prepares and presents its Balance Sheet, the 
Statement of Profit and Loss and the Statement of Changes in Equity in the format prescribed by Division III of Schedule 
III to the Act. The Statement of Cash Flows has been prepared and presented as per the requirements of Ind AS 7 
‘Statement of Cash Flows’. 
The Group generally reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis in the Balance Sheet. They are offset 
and reported net only when Ind AS specifically permits the same or it has an unconditional legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event. Similarly, the Group offsets incomes and 
expenses and reports the same on a net basis when permitted by Ind AS specifically unless they are material in nature. 
2.3 Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Company and all its subsidiaries, 
being the entities that it controls from the date control is gained. Control is evidenced where the investor is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the investee. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, 
which significantly affect the entity’s returns. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting 
year as the Parent Company. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align 
the accounting policies in line with accounting policies of the Parent Company. 
These consolidated financial statements are prepared on the following basis in accordance with Ind AS 110 on 
“Consolidated Financial Statements” specified under Section 133 of the Act. Following subsidiary companies have been 
considered in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 
i)
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through
its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the date on which controls commences until the date on which control ceases.
ii)
Non-controlling interest (“NCI”)
NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.
Changes in the Group’s equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as
equity transactions.
iii)
Loss of control
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and
any related NCI and other component of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at
fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit and
loss.

iv) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
The financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary used in the consolidation procedure are
drawn up to the same reporting date i.e. 31 March 2021. The financial statements of the Holding Company and
its subsidiary are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Intra-group balances and transactions, and unrealized income and expenses
arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as
unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. The Group follows uniform
accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. For additional information as
required by Paragraph 2 of the General Instructions for preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements to
Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, refer Note 50.
2.4 
Basis of measurement 
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for following assets and liabilities which 
have been measured at fair value: 
i)
Investments in equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
ii)
Financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
iii)
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
iv)
Investments which are held for trading
v)
Defined benefit plans.
2.5 
Functional and presentation currency 
The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR) which is also functional currency of the Group and the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. All values are rounded to the nearest lakhs, 
except when otherwise indicated.  
3.
Significant accounting policies
3.1 
Recognition of interest income
Interest income is recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial 
assets other than credit-impaired assets and financial assets classified as measured at FVTPL. 
 The EIR in case of a financial asset is computed  
a.
As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to
the gross carrying amount of a financial asset.
b.
By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.
c.
Including all fees received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate,
transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.
Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets. 
Interest income on credit impaired assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the net amortised cost 
(net of provision) of the financial asset. 
3.2 .  Recognition of revenue from sale of goods and services 
Revenue (other than for financial instruments) is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Ind 
AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers outlines a single comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising 
from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance found within Ind ASs. 
The Group recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in Ind 115: 
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that 
creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met. 
Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a 
customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. 
F 203

Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects 
to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties. 
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than 
one performance obligation, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that 
depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance 
obligation. 
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation 
Revenue from contract with customer for rendering services is recognised at a point in time when performance obligation 
is satisfied. 
3.2.1 
Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and the amount of the dividend can be measured 
reliably. 
3.2.2 
Rental Income 
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included 
in rental income in the statement of profit and loss, unless the increase is in line with expected general inflation, in which 
case lease income is recognised based on contractual terms. 
3.2.3 
Fees and commission income 
Fees and commission income such as service charges, commission from fee-based business lines, service income etc. are 
recognised on point in time basis. 
3.2.4 
Miscellaneous Income 
All other income is recognized on an accrual basis, when there is no uncertainty in the ultimate realization/collection. 
3.3 
Financial instruments  
A.
Financial Asset
3.3.1 
Initial recognition 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Loans are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account. Investments are recognised on the date when 
the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions. The Group recognises debt securities, deposits and borrowings 
when funds reach the Group and post allotment, where applicable. 
3.3.2 Initial and subsequent measurement of financial instruments 
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: 
1.
Debt instruments at amortised cost
2.
Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).
3.
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
4.
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI.
The classification depends on the contractual terms of the financial assets’ cash flows and the Group’s business model 
for managing financial assets which are explained below: 
Business model assessment 
The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to 
achieve its business objective. 
The Group's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated 
portfolios and is based on observable factors such as: 
F 204


# Page 387
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
► How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated
and reported to the entity's key management personnel
► The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model)
and the way those risks are managed
► How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of
the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected)
► The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Group’s assessment.
► The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ 
scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group's
original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that
business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial
assets going forward.
The SPPI test 
As a second step of its classification process, the Group assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify 
whether they meet the SPPI test. 
‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may 
change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the 
premium/discount). 
In making this assessment, the Group considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending 
arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks 
and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure 
to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through the 
profit and loss account or is required to measure liabilities at fair value through profit or loss such as derivative liabilities. 
3.3.3 Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect
contractual cash flows and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement at fair value plus directly attributable costs, these financial assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by considering any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in 
interest income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in statement of profit and loss. 
3.3.4 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both the following conditions are 
met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect
contractual cash flows and selling the assets and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding
Debt instruments included within the FVOCI category are measured at each reporting date at fair value with such changes 
being recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI). The interest income on these assets is recognised in profit or 
loss. Impairment losses or reversals, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit and 
loss. Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified 
from equity to the income statement.  
F 205

3.3.5 Financial Instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified 
as at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments that meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria but are designated 
as at FVTPL are measured at FVTPL. 
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVOCI criteria may be designated 
as at FVTPL upon initial recognition, if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition 
inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different 
bases. 
Group’s investment is classified as FVTPL, if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or 
repurchasing in the near term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for 
which there is evidence of short-term profit taking. 
Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value, with transaction costs 
recognised in the income statement as incurred. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value and any gains or losses are 
recognised in the income statement as they arise.  
3.3.6 Equity instruments 
The Group subsequently measures investment in equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, unless the Group’s 
management has elected to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI, when 
such instruments meet the definition of definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are 
not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Gains and losses on these equity instruments classified at FVOCI are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognised in profit or loss as dividend income when the right of the payment has been established, except when the 
Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are 
recorded in OCI.  
B. Financial Liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement 
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or the issue of financial liability, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are adjusted to fair value at initial 
recognition. 
Subsequent measurement  
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
3.4 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
3.4.1 
Financial Asset 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Group also derecognises 
the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.  
The Group has transferred the financial asset if, and only if, either: 
a)
The Group has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset
or
b)
It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full
without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass–through’ arrangement
Pass-through arrangements are transactions whereby the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows 
of a financial asset (the 'original asset'), but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more 
entities (the 'eventual recipients'), when all of the following three conditions are met: 
► The Group has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it has collected equivalent amounts
from the original asset, excluding short-term advances with the right to full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued
interest at market rates
F 206


# Page 389
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
► The Group cannot sell or pledge the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients
► The Group has to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay. In
addition, the Group is not entitled to reinvest such cash flows, except for investments in cash or cash equivalents
including interest earned, during the period between the collection date and the date of required remittance to the
eventual recipients.
A transfer only qualifies for derecognition if either: 
► The Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset
or
► The Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset
The Group considers control to be transferred if and only if, the transferee has the practical ability to sell the asset in 
its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without imposing additional 
restrictions on the transfer. 
When the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and has retained control of 
the asset, the asset continues to be recognised only to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement, in which case, 
the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a 
basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained. 
3.4.2 Financial Liability 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as de recognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability 
and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. 
3.5 Offsetting 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities 
are offset, and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and 
intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously in all the following 
circumstances: 
a.
The normal course of business
b.
The event of default
c.
The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group and/or its counter parties.
3.6 Impairment of financial assets 
3.6.1 
Overview of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) principles 
The Group has created provisions on all financial assets except for financial assets classified as FVTPL, based on the 
expected credit loss method. The Group also ensures maintaining the minimum provision requirement as per RBI and 
NHB regulations. 
The ECL provision is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit 
loss), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based 
on the 12 months’ expected credit loss. The 12-month ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs that 
result from default events on financial assets that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. 
The Group performs an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk 
has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the 
remaining life of the financial instrument. 
Based on the above process, the Group categorises its loans into three stages as described below: 
F 207


# Page 390
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
For non-impaired financial instruments 

Stage 1 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have not experienced a significant increase
in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. A 12-month ECL provision is made for stage 1 financial
instruments. In assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Group compares the risk of a default
occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date, with the risk of a default occurring on the financial
instrument as at the date of initial recognition.

Stage 2 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have experienced a SICR since initial
recognition. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for stage 2 financial instruments. In subsequent reporting
periods, if the credit risk of the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a SICR since initial
recognition, then entities recognize 12 months of ECL.
For impaired financial instruments: 
Financial instruments are classified as stage 3 when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more 
loss events that have occurred after initial recognition with a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows of a loan 
or a portfolio of loans. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for impaired financial instruments. 
3.6.2 
The calculation of ECLs 
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows: 
Probability of Default (PD) - The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time 
horizon. 
The Group uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products and schemes, 
the Group has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach 
considering fresh slippage using historical information.  
Exposure at Default (EAD) - The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering 
expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether 
scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed 
payments.  
Loss Given Default (LGD) – The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs 
at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect 
to receive.  
Forward looking information 
While estimating the expected credit losses, the Group reviews macro-economic developments occurring in the economy 
and market it operates in. On a periodic basis, the Group analyses if there is any relationship between key economic 
trends like GDP, unemployment rates, benchmark rates set by the Reserve Bank of India, inﬂation etc. with the estimate 
of PD, LGD determined by the Group based on its internal data. While the internal estimates of PD, LGD rates by the 
Group may not be always reﬂective of such relationships, temporary overlays, if any, are embedded in the methodology 
to reﬂect such macro-economic trends reasonably. 
Write-offs 
Loans are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case 
when it is determined that the customer does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufﬁcient cash 
ﬂows to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are credited to the 
statement of proﬁt and loss. 
Collateral 
To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Group seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in 
various forms, such as gold, cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, stock, current asset etc. However, the fair value 
of collateral affects the calculation of ECLs. The fair value of the same is based on data provided by third party or 
management judgements. 
F 208

Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Impairment of Trade receivables 
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The Group 
uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix 
is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables. 
3.7 Determination of fair value 
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, investments at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
i.
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
ii.
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability, if market participants act in their economic best interest. 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits 
by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use. 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which enough data are available 
to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
The financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as summarised below: 
Level 1 financial instruments − Those where the inputs used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group has access to at the measurement date. The Group considers 
markets as active only if there are sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical 
assets or liabilities and when there are binding and exercisable price quotes available on the balance sheet date. 
Level 2 financial instruments − Those where the inputs that are used for valuation and are significant, are derived from 
directly or indirectly observable market data available over the entire period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include 
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets 
and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit 
spreads. In addition, adjustments may be required for the condition or location of the asset or the extent to which it relates 
to items that are comparable to the valued instrument. However, if such adjustments are based on unobservable inputs 
which are significant to the entire measurement, the Group will classify the instruments as Level 3. 
Level 3 financial instruments − Those that include one or more unobservable input that is signiﬁcant to the measurement 
as whole. 
3.8 Foreign Currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the spot rate of ex-change ruling at 
the date of the transaction. However, for practical reasons, the Group uses an average rate if the average approximates 
the actual rate at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot 
rate of exchange at the reporting date. All differences arising on non–trading activities are taken to other income/expense 
in the statement of profit and loss.  
Non–monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange 
rates as at the date of recognition. 
3.9 Finance cost 
Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying 
amount of financial liabilities other than financial liabilities classified as FVTPL. 
F 209


# Page 392
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognized as part of the carrying value of the financial liability 
and amortized over the expected life using the effective interest method. These include fees and commissions payable 
to advisers and other expenses such as external legal costs, provided these are incremental costs that are directly related 
to the issue of a financial liability. 
3.10 Other income and expenses  
All Other income and expense are recognized in the period they occur. 
3.11  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand, short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less and forex balances, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short- term deposits, as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts, if any as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management. 
3.12   Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, 
(if any). The total cost of assets comprises its purchase price, freight, duties, taxes and any other incidental expenses 
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by the management.  
Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, 
and treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible asset are added to its gross value only if it increases the future 
benefits of the existing asset, beyond its previously assessed standards of performance and cost can be measured reliably. 
Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed off as and when incurred. 
3.13 Depreciation 
Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost comprises the purchase price and any 
attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.  
Depreciation is charged based on a review by the management during the year and at the rates derived based on the useful 
lives of the assets as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 or estimated useful lives estimated by the 
respective management based on technical evaluation. The holding company and one of its subsidiaries, Muthoot 
Microfin Limited follow the Straight Line Method for providing depreciation whereas the two other subsidiaries follow 
Written Down Value Method.  
Leasehold improvements and assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of lease term or their useful 
life. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each 
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
Property plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in other income / expense in the statement of profit and loss in the year 
the asset is derecognised. The date of disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the date the recipient obtains 
control of that item in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in 
Ind AS 115. 
3.14   Capital work-in-progress 
Capital work-in-progress are carried at cost, comprising direct cost and related incidental expenses. Assets which are not 
ready for intended use are also shown under capital work-in-progress. 
3.15    Intangible assets 
The Group’s intangible assets consist of computer software.

Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the expected future 
economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the Group. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises 
its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use and net of any 
trade discounts and rebates. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised by the Group over a period of 3 years, except in case of Muthoot Pappachan Technologies 
Limited where the computer software is amortised over a period of 10 years or over the estimated useful lives. 
Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. 
3.16   Investment Property 
Properties, held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation are classified as investment property and measured and reported 
at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the assets carrying amount only when it is 
probable that the future economic benefit associated with the expenditure will flow to the company. 
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from 
use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of property 
is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the same period. 
3.17 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Groups assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal 
and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset 
or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining 
fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are considered. If no such transactions can be identified, an 
appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for 
publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the 
assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal 
is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which 
case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. 
3.18 
Post-employment benefits 
3.18.1 Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to the Employees Provident Fund Scheme maintained by the Central Government, Employee State 
Insurance Corporation (ESIC) etc. are accounted for on an accrual basis. Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund 
is a defined contribution scheme.  
The Group has no obligation, other than the contribution payable under the schemes. The Group recognizes contribution 
payable to the provident fund scheme / ESIC as expenditure, when an employee renders the related service. If the 
contribution payable to the scheme / ESIC for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution 
already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. 
F 211


# Page 394
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then 
excess is recognized as an asset. 
3.18.2 
Defined Benefit schemes 
Gratuity 
The Group provides for gratuity covering eligible employees under which a lump sum payment is paid to vested 
employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount reckoned on the respective 
employee’s salary and his tenor of employment with the Group. The Group accounts for its liability for future gratuity 
benefits based on actuarial valuation determined at each Balance Sheet date by an Independent Actuary using Projected 
Unit Credit Method. The Group makes contributions to a Gratuity Fund administered by the Life Insurance Corporation 
of India.  
The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining 
the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan are based on the market yields on Government Securities 
as at the Balance Sheet date.     
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities 
involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. 
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net deﬁned 
beneﬁt liability), are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to other equity 
through OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassiﬁed to statement of proﬁt and loss in 
subsequent periods. 
3.19 
Share Based Payments 
The Group has formulated an Employees Stock Option Scheme to be administered through respective Trusts for its 
subsidiaries MML and MHFCL. The fair value of options granted under Employee Stock Option Plan is recognised as 
an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in other equity. The total amount to be expensed is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the options. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is 
the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the estimates 
of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting and service conditions are revised. It 
recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in Statement of Profit and Loss, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity. 
3.20 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the enterprise determines the level of provision by discounting 
the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific to the liability. The expense relating to any 
provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. 
3.21 
Assets held for sale 
Assets possessed against the settlement of loans are carried in the balance sheet at a value of outstanding principal loan 
amount or fair value of asset whichever is lower. In case the fair value of the asset acquired is lower than the outstanding 
principal loan amount; then the shortfall is to be provided for in the books of account in such financial year. 
These assets are classified as ‘Assets held for sale’ under ‘Non-financial assets’ till the asset acquired is finally disposed. 
The outstanding overdue interest and other charges will be accounted on realization basis.  
Further, if on disposal of the assets so acquired, the sale proceed is higher than the receivable amount (including 
outstanding loan, outstanding overdue interest, other charges and interest), then the Company will refund the excess 
amount to the borrowers.

3.22 
Taxes 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
3.21.1 Current Tax 
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of taxable profit for a period. Taxable profit differs from 
‘profit before tax’ as reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws.  
Interest income / expenses and penalties, if any, related to income tax are included in current tax expense. The tax rates 
and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of reporting date 
in India where the Group operates and generates taxable income. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either 
in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
3.22.2 Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is probable 
that future taxable amounts will arise to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax assets are reviewed 
at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities are realised 
simultaneously. 
3.22.3 Goods and services tax /value added taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses 
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the goods and services tax/value added taxes paid, except: 
i.
When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in
which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense
item, as applicable
ii.
When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included
The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the balance sheet. 
3.23 
Contingent Liabilities and assets 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present 
obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized 
because it cannot be measured reliably. The Group does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in 
the ﬁnancial statements. 
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be conﬁrmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity. The 
Group does not have any contingent assets in the ﬁnancial statements.

3.24 
Earnings Per Share 
The Group reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic EPS 
is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting preference 
dividend and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity 
shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have been 
issued at a later date. In computing the dilutive earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that 
either reduces the earnings per share or increases loss per share are included. 
3.25 
Dividends on ordinary shares 
The Group recognises a liability to make distributions to equity holders of the Group when the distribution is authorised, 
and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is 
authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. 
3.26 
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement 
and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or 
assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
Transition to Ind AS 116 
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) through Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2019 
and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Second Amendment Rules, had notified Ind AS 116 Leases which 
replaced the existing lease standard, Ind AS 17 Leases, and other interpretations. Ind AS 116 set out the principles for 
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. It introduced a single, on-
balance sheet lease accounting model for leases. 
The Group has adopted Ind AS 116, effective annual reporting period beginning April 1, 2019, using modified 
retrospective approach and accordingly previous period information has not been reinstated.  
Group as a lessee 
The Groups lease asset class consists of building, equipment and vehicles. The Group assesses whether a contract contains 
a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group has, at the date of transition, recognized 
a right-of use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less (short term lease) and low value assets. For these short-term and low value leases, 
the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  
The right-of-use assets are recognized at cost, which comprises the present value of the lease liability as at the date of 
transition. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the balance lease term and useful 
life of the underlying asset. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future 
lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit on the lease or, if not readily 
determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates. Interest accrued on lease liability and lease payments made, are 
subsequently adjusted to the initial recognition of lease liability. 
On application of Ind AS 116, the nature of expenses has changed from lease rent in previous periods to depreciation cost 
for the right-to-use asset, and finance cost for interest accrued on lease liability. For leases that were classified as finance 
lease applying Ind AS 17, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of transition to 
Ind AS 116 is the carrying amount of the lease asset and the lease liability on the transition date as measured applying 
Ind AS 17. 
Group as a lessor 
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased 
items are operating leases. Rental Income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the 
lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss.

3.27 
Cash flow statement 
Cash flows are reported using indirect method, whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions 
of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments and items of income or 
expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from regular revenue generating (operating 
activities), investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. 
4. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the 
accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimates are revised, and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the 
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could 
result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. 
In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognized in the ﬁnancial statements is included in the 
following notes: 
4.1 
Business Model Assessment 
Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The 
Group determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to 
achieve a business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the 
performance of the assets is evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets 
and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Group monitors financial assets 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity 
to understand the reason for their disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for 
which the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Group’s continuous assessment of whether the business model for 
which the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has 
been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the classification of those assets. 
4.2 
Deﬁned employee beneﬁt assets and liabilities 
The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial 
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the 
future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly sensitive to changes 
in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
4.3 
Fair value measurement 
When the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based 
on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using various valuation techniques. The inputs to these 
models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required 
in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. 
Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of ﬁnancial instruments. 
4.4 
Impairment of financial assets 
The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement the estimation of the 
amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when determining impairment losses and the assessment of 
a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by several factors, changes in which can result in different 
levels of allowances. 
It has been the Group’s policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust when 
necessary.  
F 215

Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
4.5 
Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method 
The Group’s EIR methodology, recognises interest income / expense using a rate of return that represents the best estimate 
of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of loans given / taken and recognises the effect of potentially 
different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments and 
penalty interest and charges). 
This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and lifecycle of the 
instruments, as well expected changes to India’s base rate and other fee income/expense that are integral parts of the 
instrument. 
4.6 
Lease Term 

The determination of lease term for some lease contracts in which the Company is a lessee, including whether the
Company is reasonably certain to exercise lessee options.

The determination of the incremental borrowing rate used to measure lease liabilities.
4.7 
Share based payments
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation 
model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most 
appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and 
making assumptions about them. 
4.8 
Other estimates 
These include contingent liabilities, useful lives of tangible and intangible assets etc.

The Group has sold some loans and advances as a source of finance. As per terms of the deal, risk and reward has been transferred to the customer. Hence, as per the derecognition criteria of IND AS 109,
including transfer of substantially all risks and rewards relating to assets being transferred to the buyer being met, the assets have been derecognised. The table below summarises the carrying amount of the
derecognised financial assets.
Under previous GAAP, retained interest receivable on loan assignment transactions were recognised over the period of such assigned loans. Under Ind AS, the gain arising on said transactions are recorded
upfront by discounting the future cash flows accruing in the form of differential interest on such assigned loan to their present values. 
The Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer. The Group securitised its gold and mircofinance loans to different entities. These entities are not related to the Group. Also, the
Group neither holds any equity or other interest nor controls them. 
As per the terms of the agreement, the Group is exposed to first loss amounting to 5% - 7% (6% - 7% as at March 31, 2020) of the amount securitised and therefore continues to be exposed to significant risk and
rewards relating to the underlying gold and microfinance loans. These receivables are not derecognised and proceeds received are recorded as a financial liability under borrowings.
The table below outlines the carrying amounts and fair values of all financial assets transferred that are not derecognised in their entirety and associated liabilities.

Social Responsibility Policy, being two per cent of the average net profits of the company made during the three immediately preceding financial years. The

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to equity holders of Parent Company by the weighted average
number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of Parent Company (after adjusting for interest on the convertible preference
shares and interest on the convertible bond, in each case, net of tax, if any) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year plus the
weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most
advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly
observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based
on a hierarchy of valuation techniques. 
The following table shows an analysis of financial instruments recorded at fair value by level of the fair value hierarchy as at 31st March

The categories used are as follows:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in an active market;
Level 2: Directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs; and
Level 3: Inputs which are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair value technique
Investments at fair value
Investment at fair value through profit and loss
Loan assets carried at fair value through other comprehensive income 
Loan receivables valuation is carried out for two portfolios segregated on the basis of repayment frequency – monthly and weekly. The valuation
of each portfolio is done by discounting the aggregate future cash flows with risk-adjusted discounting rate for the remaining portfolio tenor. 
Following inputs have been used to calculate the fair value of loans receivables:
(i) Future cash flows: Include principal receivable, interest receivable and tenor information based on the repayment schedule agreed with the
borrowers.
(ii) Risk-adjusted discount rate:
This rate has been arrived using the cost of funds approach.
The fair value of financial instruments as referred to in note 'A' above has been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the
valuation technique. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The equity instruments which are actively traded on public stock exchanges with readily available active prices on a regular basis are classified as
Level 1. Units held in mutual funds are measured based on their published net asset value (NAV), taking into account redemption and/or other
restrictions are generally Level 1. Equity instruments in non-listed entities are initially recognised at transaction price and re-measured as per fair
valuation report and valued on a case-by-case has been classified as Level 2.
For investment at fair value through profit and loss, valuation are done using quoted prices from active markets or on published Net Asset Values
of the investment at the measurement date.

Financial liability at amortised cost
For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts, which are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their
fair value. Such instruments include: cash and balances, Trade receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents and trade payables without a specific maturity. Such amounts have been
classified as Level 3 on the basis that no adjustments have been made to the balances in the balance sheet.
The fair values of financial assets held-to-maturity are estimated using a effective interest rate model based on contractual cash flows using actual yields.
The fair values of financial liability held-to-maturity are estimated using a effective interest rate  model based on contractual cash flows using actual yields. 
Set out below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the financial statements. This table does
not include the fair values of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.

The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise of borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the Group’s operations. The Group’s principal financial assets
include loans, investments, cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other receivables that derive directly from its operations. 
As a financial lending institution, Group is exposed to various risks that are related to lending business and operating environment. The principal objective in Group 's risk management processes is to measure and monitor the various
risks that Group is subject to and to follow policies and procedures to address such risks. 
The Groups Risk Management Committee (RMC) comprise of the Board of directors constituted in accordance with the RBI rules. The RMC has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Risk Management Policy.
The committee meets on a quarterly basis to review the risk management practices and working of the risk management department. The committee is chaired by an Independent Director. Risk Management Department periodically
places its report to the committee for review. The committee’s suggestions for improving the risk management practices are implemented by the Risk Management Department.  
The Group has implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to assess, monitor and manage risk throughout the Group. The risk management process is continuously reviewed, improved and adapted in the changing risk
scenario and the agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the changing risk landscape. The process of continuous evaluation of risks includes taking stock of the risk landscape on an
event-driven basis. The Group has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically adressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis.
The major type of risk Group faces in business are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk.
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group’s major income generating activity is gold loan, housing loan, microfinance loan 
personal loans and others.
The Group addressess credit risk through following major processess:
- Standardize the process of identifying new risks and designing appropriate controls for these risks
- Minimize losses due to defaults or untimely payments by borrowers
- Maintain an appropriate credit administration and loan review system 
- Establish metrics for portfolio monitoring
- Design appropriate credit risk mitigation techniques
- Structured and standardised credit approval process
- Verification of credit history from credit bureau agencies, personal verification of customers business and  residence
- Technical and Legal Verification
- Comprehensive credit risk assessment and cash flow analysis
In order to mitigate the impact of credit risk in the future profitability, the Company makes reserves basis the expected credit loss (ECL model) for the outstanding loans.
The Group’s impairment assessment and measurement approach is set out in this note. It should be read in conjunction with the Summary of significant accounting policies.
The Group considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.
As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Group also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such events occur, the Group carefully considers whether the event
should result in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate.
It is the Group’s policy to consider a financial instrument as ‘cured’ and therefore re-classified out of Stage 3 when none of the default criteria have been present for at least six consecutive months. The decision whether to classify an
asset as Stage 2 or Stage 1 once cured depends on the updated credit grade, at the time of the cure, and whether this indicates there has been a significant increase in credit risk compared to initial recognition.

LGD Rates have been computed internally based on the discounted recoveries in NPA accounts that are closed/ written off/ repossessed and upgraded during the year. 
Significant Increase in credit risk
II) Liquidity risk
 Asset Liability Management (ALM)
 Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group may not meet its financial obligations. Liquidity risk arises due to the unavailability of adequate funds at an appropriate cost or tenure. The objective of liquidity risk management, is to 
maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Group consistently generates sufficient cash flows from operating and financial activities to meet its financial obligations as and when they 
fall due.  Our resource mobilisation team sources funds from multiple sources, including from banks, financial institutions, capital & retail markets to maintain a healthy mix of sources. The resource mobilisation team is responsible for 
diversifying fund raising sources, managing interest rate risks and maintaining a strong relationship with banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies, other domestic and foreign financial institutions and rating 
agencies to ensure the liquidity risk is well addressed.
The outstanding balance as at the reporting date is considered as EAD by the Group.
The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. To calculate the ECL for a Stage 1 loan, the Group assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the calculation of the 12
month ECL. For Stage 2 and Stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the instruments. The Group uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the
different products and schemes, the Group has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental 90 day DPD approach considering fresh slippage using historical information. 
Based on its review of macro-economic developments and economic outlook, the Group has assessed that no adjustment is required for temporary overlays to determine qualitative impact on its PD's as at 31st March 2021 and 31st
March 2020.
The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive.
When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Group applies the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
The internal rating model evaluates the loans on an ongoing basis. The rating model also assesses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the previously assigned risk grade. One key factor that indicates significant 
increase in credit risk is when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.

III) Market risk
Interest rate risk
Market Risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market factor. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the interest
rates and other market changes. The Group is exposed to two types of market risk as follows:
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group is  subject to interest rate risk, principally because we lend to clients at fixed interest 
rates and for periods that may differ from our funding sources, while our borrowings are at both fixed and variable interest rates for different periods.  We assess and manage our interest rate risk by managing our assets and liabilities. 
Our Asset Liability Management Committee evaluates asset liability management, and ensures that all significant mismatches, if any, are being managed appropriately.

Prepayment risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Group will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment earlier or later than expected.
Operational and business risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to operate effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or 
lead to financial loss. The Group cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but it endeavours to manage these risks through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include effective 
segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, such as the use of internal audit.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion of  borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the profit before taxes affected through the impact on 
floating rate borrowings, debt securities and subordinate laibilities are as follows:
Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decreases as the result of changes in level of equity indices and individual stocks.  The trading and non-trading equity price risk  exposure arises from equity securities classified 
at FVTPl and FVOCI respectively”.
A 10% increase/(decrease) in the  equity price (traded and non-traded) would have the impact as follows:

45 Impact of Covid-19
The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact and volatility in the global and domestic economies resulting in decrease in economic activities. Increase in infection rate and lockdowns / movement
restrictions announced by the Central Government and various State Governments in lndia and the outbreak of the second wave of the pandemic may further slowdown the economic activity. Though there is stress on collection of dues
from customers, this has not resulted in a significant impact on the financial position of the Group as at the reporting date.
Pursuant to the relevant Reserve Bank of India circulars allowing lending institutions to offer moratorium to borrowers on payment of instalments falling due between March 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020, the Group had granted
moratorium to its borrowers based on its Board approved policy. For such accounts, where the moratorium was granted, the asset / stage-wise classification remained stand still during the moratorium period. Pursuant to the judgement
of the Honourable Supreme Court dated March 23, 2021, vacating the interim order not to declare accounts as NPA and the RBI circular thereon, the Group has carried out the asset classification of borrowers as at March 31, 2021 as
per the ECL model and the extant RBI instructions / IRAC norms. Further, in accordance with the relevant circulars on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector – Restructuring of Advances, the Company has restructured
a total of 1,600 MSME accounts, amounting to INR 2,703.11 during the year ended March 31, 2021. The Group continues to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its liquidity and ability to repay its obligations as and
when they fall due and the management believes that the Group will be able to pay its obligations as and when these become due in the foreseeable future. The Group would continue to focus on maintaining adequate capital and
ensuring liquidity at all points in time. The Group has recorded a management overlay allowance of INR 4,613.89 (P.Y. INR 8,167.51) in its Expected Credit Loss provision in view of the circumstances following the pandemic, based
on the information available at this time.

How it's been addressed in Audit 
We have accessed the laid down systems 
and 
processes 
of 
the 
Company 
in 
identifying related party transactions and 
its 
ultimate 
disclosure 
in 
financial 
statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
applicable reporting framework. We have 
designed 
the 
audit 
procedures 
in 
accordance with the guidelines prescribed 
in Standard on Auditing (SA 550) to 
identify the risks of materi�l misstatement 
ansmg 
from 
an 
entity's 
failure 
to 
appropriately account for or 
disclose 
material related party transactions. We 
have also reviewed the minutes of meetings 
of the board in the course of the audit to 
identify any transactions that may require 
disclosure in accordance with th·e applicable 
reporting framework. 
Due to the automated controls and high 
degree of dependence in information 
systems, there is a risk that the financial 
accounting and reporting records may be 
misstated in case of any control lapses in 
the IT system related controls. We have 
designed 
our 
audit 
procedures 
in 
accordance with the guidelines laid down 
in the Standard ort Auditing (SA 5

which has an impact on the financial 
accounting and reporting records. We have 
also tested on a sample basis the controls 
related to access management including 
user rights in passing entries, approval for 
authorizing 
entries, 
authorization 
for 
reversing entries, segregation of duties, 
system 
password 
protection, 
external 
software/hardware access rights etc. Based 
on our 
sample review, no material 
weakness was identified in the IT related 
systems and controls. 
At the branch level, entries related to daily 
operations are passed. We have addressed 
this as a key audit matter since any control 
lapses in the branch level accounting may 
result in the financial accounting and 
reporting records of the entity being 
misstated. We have physically visited the 
entity's branches on a sample basis to 
identify and assess the effectiveness of the 
controls operating at the branch level. We 
have also tested on a sample basis the 
independent financial records maintained 
at the branch level and how· the same is 
considered 
and 
incorporated 
in 
the 
financial statements. We have also assessed 
and analyzed the internal audit reports and 
how the major observations are dealt with 
and its impact on the entity's financial 
accounting and reporting records. 
Based on our sample review,· ·no major 
weaknesses were identified.

In connection with our audit of the Standalone Ind AS financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. 
When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance. We 
have nothing to report in this regard. 
Responsibilities of Management and those charged with governance for the standalone 
Ind AS Financial Statements 
The Company's Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of 
the Act with respect to the preparation of these Standalone Ind AS financial statements that 
give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance,. changes in equity 
and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the 
Act, read with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules,. 2014. This responsibility also 
includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;. and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and 
fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the Standalone Ind AS financial statements, the board of directors are 
responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the board of directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial 
reporting process. 
Auditor's Responsibilities for the- Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standal.0:m!==t:D:iil

or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assuran-ce, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these Standalone Ind AS financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
•
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Ind AS
financial statements, whether dy.e to frau4 or error, design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control.
•
Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether
the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in . place and the
operating effectiveness of such controls.
•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
•
Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of
accounting and; based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the
related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may c�use
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the St���-""-.:&!� ...

financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair.presentation. 
Materiality is the magnitude of misstate�ents in the Standalone Ind AS financial statements 
that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in planning the scope of our audit work and 
in evaluating the results of our work; and to evaluate the effect of any identified 
misstatements in the Standalone Ind AS financial statements. 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal contro\ that we id�ntify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied 
with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them 
all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

ANNEXURE-"B" TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT 
Referred to in paragraph 2(f) under 'Report on other legal and regulatory requirements' of 
the Independent Auditors' Report of even date to the members of Muthoot Fincorp Limited 
on the Ind AS Financial Statements as of and for the year ended 31 March 2023 
REPORT ON THE INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS UNDER CLAUSE (I) OF SUB­
SECTION 3 OF SECTION 143 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013 ("THE ACT") 
Opinion 
We have audited the internal financial co�trols over ,financial reporting of Muthoot Fincorp 
Limited ("the Company"), as of March 31, .2023 in conjunction with our audit of the Ind AS 
Financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. 
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial 
reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

Auditors' Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal financial controls over 
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 
"Guidance Note") Standards on Auditing, both issued by the ICAI and deemed to be prescribed 
under Section 143 (10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls. Those standards and the guidance note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the 
internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our 
audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding 
of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial control system over financial 
reporting. 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 
A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those 
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accord
;,,an�c=�
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) pr 
F 288


# Page 471
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or thaJ the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.

3. Significant accounting policies
3.1 
Recognition of interest income
Interest income is recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial assets other than credit-impaired assets and financial assets classified as
measured at FVTPL.
 The EIR in case of a financial asset is computed: 
a.
As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset.
b.
By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.
c.
Including all fees received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.
Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets. Interest income is not 
recognized on credit impaired assets. 
3.2   Recognition of revenue from sale of goods and services 
Revenue (other than for financial instruments) is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers outlines a single 
comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance found within Ind ASs. 
The Company recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in Ind AS 115: 
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every 
contract that must be met. 
Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. 
Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services 
to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. 
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to 
each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. 
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation 
Revenue from contract with customer for rendering services is recognised at a point in time when performance obligation is satisfied.

3.2.1 
Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and 
the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably. 
3.2.2 
Rental Income 
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss, unless the increase 
is in line with expected general inflation, in which case lease income is recognised based on contractual terms. 
3.2.3 
Fees and commission income 
Fees and commission income such as service charges, commission from fee based business lines, service income etc. are recognised on point in time basis. 
3.2.4 
Net gain / loss on fair value changes 
The Company designates certain financial assets for subsequent measurement at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The 
Company recognises gains / losses on fair value change of financial assets measured at FVTPL on net basis. 
3.2.5 
Net gain on derecognition of financial instruments 
Gains arising out of direct assignment transactions comprise the difference between the interest on the loan portfolio and the applicable rate at which the direct assignment is entered into with 
the assignee, also known as the excess interest spread (EIS).  
3.3 Financial instruments 
1.1.1. Initial recognition 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition 
of the financial asset. 
Loans are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account. Investments are recognised on settlement date. The Company recognises debt securities and borrowings when funds 
reach the Company, post allotment if applicable. 
1.1.2. Initial and subsequent measurement of financial instruments 
The Company classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: 
1.
Debt instruments at amortised cost
2.
Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
3.
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
4.
Equity instruments in subsidiary companies at cost
5.
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI
The classification depends on the contractual terms of the financial assets’ cash flows and the Company’s business model for managing financial assets which are explained below: 
Business model assessment 
The Company determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective. 
F 296


# Page 479
The Company's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as: 
► How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity's key management personnel
► The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and the way those risks are managed
► How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected)
► The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Company’s assessment. The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without
taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Company's original expectations, the Company
does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased
financial assets going forward.
The SPPI test 
As a second step of its classification process, the Company assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. 
 ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments 
of principal or amortisation of the premium/discount). 
In making this assessment, the Company considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value 
of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are 
inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
The Company classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through the profit and loss account or is required to measure liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss such as derivative liabilities. 
1.1.3. Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement at fair value plus directly attributable costs, these financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised 
cost is calculated by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in interest income in the profit or 
loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in statement of profit and loss. 
F 297


# Page 480
1.1.4. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and selling the assets and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding
Debt instruments included within the FVOCI category are measured at each reporting date at fair value with such changes being recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI). The interest 
income on these assets is recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses or reversals, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Upon disposal, the 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement.  
1.1.5. Financial Instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments that meet the amortised cost 
criteria or the FVTOCI criteria but are designated as at FVTPL are measured at FVTPL. 
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVOCI criteria may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition, if such designation eliminates 
or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases. 
Company’s investment is classified as FVTPL, if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial 
instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of short-term profit taking. 
Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value, with transaction costs recognised in the income statement as incurred. Subsequently, they are 
measured at fair value and any gains or losses are recognised in the income statement as they arise.  
1.1.6. Equity instruments 
The Company subsequently measures investment in equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, unless the Company’s management has elected to classify irrevocably some of its 
equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI, when such instruments meet the definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. Such 
classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Gains and losses on these equity instruments classified at FVOCI are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised in profit or loss as dividend income when the right of the payment 
has been established, except when the Company benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI.  
3.3.1  Financial Liabilities 
Initial Measurement 
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition or the issue of financial liability, which are not at fair value through 
profit or loss, are adjusted to fair value at initial recognition. 
F 298


# Page 481
Subsequent Measurement  
Financial liabilities except cumulative compulsorily convertible preference shares, are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
3.4 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
3.4.1 Financial Asset 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from 
the financial asset have expired. The Company also derecognises the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.  
The Company has transferred the financial asset if, and only if, either: 
a)
The Company has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset
or
b)
It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass–
through’ arrangement
Pass-through arrangements are transactions whereby the Company retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of a financial asset (the 'original asset'), but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more entities (the 'eventual recipients'), when all of the following three conditions are met: 
► The Company has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it has collected equivalent amounts from the original asset, excluding short-term
advances with the right to full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued interest at market rates
► The Company cannot sell or pledge the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients
► The Company has to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay. In addition, the Company is not entitled to reinvest such
cash flows, except for investments in cash or cash equivalents including interest earned, during the period between the collection date and the date of required remittance
to the eventual recipients.
A transfer only qualifies for derecognition if either: 
► The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or,
► The Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset
► The Company considers control to be transferred if and only if, the transferee has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is
able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without imposing additional restrictions on the transfer.
When the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and has retained control of the asset, the asset continues to be recognised 
only to the extent of the Company’s continuing involvement, in which case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained. 
F 299


# Page 482
3.4.2 Financial Liability 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender 
on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as de recognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. 
3.5 Offsetting 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when the 
Company has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously in all the following circumstances: 
a.
The normal course of business
b.
The event of default
c.
The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company and/or its counter parties.
3.6 Impairment of financial assets 
3.6.1 
Overview of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) principles 
The Company has created provisions on all financial assets wherever required, except for financial assets classified as FVTPL, based on the expected credit loss method. 
The ECL provision is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since 
origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss. The 12-month ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs that result from default 
events on financial assets that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. 
The Company performs an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the 
change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. 
Based on the above process, the Company categorises its loans into three stages as described below: 
For non-impaired financial instruments 

Stage 1 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have not experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. A 12-month ECL provision
is made for stage 1 financial instruments. In assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument
as at the reporting date, with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition.

Stage 2 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have experienced a SICR since initial recognition. The Company recognises lifetime ECL for stage 2 financial
instruments. In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit risk of the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a SICR since initial recognition, then entities recognize
12 months of ECL.
For impaired financial instruments: 
Financial instruments are classified as stage 3 when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more loss events that have occurred after initial recognition with a negative 
F 300

impact on the estimated future cash flows of a loan or a portfolio of loans. The Company recognises lifetime ECL for impaired financial instruments. 
3.6.2 
The calculation of ECLs 
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows: 
Probability of Default (PD) - The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. 
The Company uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products, schemes, ticket size, loan to value and geographies, the Company has bifurcated 
its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach considering fresh slippage using historical information.  
Exposure at Default (EAD) - The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including 
repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.  
Loss Given Default (LGD) – The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual 
cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive.  
Forward looking information 
While estimating the expected credit losses, the Company reviews macro-economic developments occurring in the economy and market it operates in. On a periodic basis, the Company analyses 
if there is any relationship between key economic trends like GDP, unemployment rates, benchmark rates set by the Reserve Bank of India, inﬂation etc. with the estimate of PD, LGD determined 
by the Company based on its internal data. While the internal estimates of PD, LGD rates by the Company may not be always reﬂective of such relationships, temporary overlays, if any, are 
embedded in the methodology to reﬂect such macro-economic trends reasonably. 
Write-offs 
Loans and other assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when it is determined that the customer does not have 
assets or sources of income that could generate sufﬁcient cash ﬂows to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are credited to the statement of 
proﬁt and loss. 
Collateral 
To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Company seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in various forms, such as gold, securities, stock, current asset etc. 
However, the fair value of collateral affects the calculation of ECLs. The fair value of the same is based on data provided by third party or management judgements. 
Impairment of Trade receivables 
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance 
on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables. 
3.7 Determination of fair value 
The Company measures financial instruments, such as, investments at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
F 301


# Page 484
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement 
is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
i.
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
ii.
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, if market participants act in their economic best 
interest. 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. 
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which enough data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
The financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as summarised below: 
Level 1 financial instruments − Those where the inputs used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has access to at 
the measurement date. The Company considers markets as active only if there are sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical assets or liabilities and 
when there are binding and exercisable price quotes available on the balance sheet date. 
Level 2 financial instruments − Those where the inputs that are used for valuation and are significant, are derived from directly or indirectly observable market data available over the entire 
period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets and observable inputs 
other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit spreads. In addition, adjustments may be required for the condition or location of the asset or the 
extent to which it relates to items that are comparable to the valued instrument. However, if such adjustments are based on unobservable inputs which are significant to the entire measurement, 
the Company will classify the instruments as Level 3. 
Level 3 financial instruments − Those that include one or more unobservable input that is signiﬁcant to the measurement as whole. 
3.8 Foreign Currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies, if any, are initially recorded in the functional currency at the spot rate of ex-change ruling at the date of the transaction. However, for practical reasons, the 
Company uses an average rate if the average approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. All differences arising on non–
trading activities are taken to other income/expense in the statement of profit and loss.  
Non–monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rates as at the date of recognition. 
F 302


# Page 485
3.9 Finance cost 
Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial liabilities other than financial liabilities classified as 
FVTPL. 
Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognized as part of the carrying value of the financial liability and amortized over the expected life using the effective interest method. 
These include fees including upfront costs incurred in relation to borrowings, commissions payable to advisers and other expenses such as external legal costs, provided these are incremental 
costs that are directly related to the issue of a financial liability. Interest accrued on lease liability recognized and measured in accordance with Ind AS 116 “Leases” also forms part of Finance 
cost. 
3.10 Other income and expenses  
All Other income and expense are recognized in the period they occur. 
3.11  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand, short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less and forex balances, which are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short- term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts, if any, as they are 
considered an integral part of the Company’s cash management. 
3.12   Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, (if any). The total cost of assets comprises its purchase price, freight, 
duties, taxes and any other incidental expenses directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the 
management.  
Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible asset are added to its gross value only if it increases the future benefits of the existing asset, beyond its previously assessed standards of 
performance and cost can be measured reliably. Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed off as and when incurred. 
3.12.1 
Depreciation 
Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended 
use.  
Depreciation is charged based on a review by the management during the year and at the rates derived based on the useful lives of the assets as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 
2013 on Straight Line Method.   
F 303


# Page 486
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Particulars 
Useful life 
Buildings 
60 years 
Computer 
3 years 
Furniture and Fixtures 
5 to 30 years 
Plant and Equipment 
5 to 20 years 
Vehicles 
5 to 8 years  
Windmill 
22 years 
Office equipment 
15 years 
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
Property plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the year the asset is derecognised. The date of disposal of 
an item of property, plant and equipment is the date the recipient obtains control of that item in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in 
Ind AS 115. 
3.13    Intangible assets 
The Company’s intangible assets consist of computer software. 
An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the Company. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure on making 
the asset ready for its intended use and net of any trade discounts and rebates. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised using the Written down value method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets 
comprising of software are amortised on a Written down value basis over a period of 3 years keeping residual value 5%. 
Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.

3.14   Investment Property 
Properties, held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation are classified as investment property and measured and reported at cost, including transaction costs, borrowing cost and other directly 
attributable cost in bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that the future 
economic benefit associated with the expenditure will flow to the company. 
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any 
gain or loss arising on derecognition of property is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the same period. 
The fair value of investment property is disclosed in the notes accompanying these financial statements. Fair value has been determined by an independent valuer who holds a recognised and 
relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued. 
3.15 Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Company’s assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, 
the Company estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in 
use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When 
the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are considered. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation 
model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, 
the Company estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit 
or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. 
3.16 Post-employment benefits 
3.16.1 Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to the Employees Provident Fund Scheme maintained by the Central Government, Employee State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) etc. are accounted for on an accrual basis. 
Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined contribution scheme.  
The company has no obligation, other than the contribution payable under the schemes. The company recognizes contribution payable to the provident fund scheme / ESIC as expenditure, when 
an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme / ESIC for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit 
payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the 
balance sheet date, then excess is recognized as an asset.

Defined Benefit schemes 
Gratuity 
The Company provides for gratuity covering eligible employees under which a lumpsum payment is paid to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, 
of an amount reckoned on the respective employee’s salary and his tenor of employment with the Company. The Company accounts for its liability for future gratuity benefits based on actuarial 
valuation determined at each Balance Sheet date by an Independent Actuary using Projected Unit Credit Method. The Company makes contributions to a Gratuity Fund administered by the Life 
Insurance Corporation of India.  
The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan are based 
on the market yields on Government Securities as at the Balance Sheet date.     
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases 
and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed 
at each reporting date. 
Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability), are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with 
a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassiﬁed to proﬁt and loss in subsequent periods. 
Other long-term employee benefits 
Company’s liabilities towards compensated absences to employees are accrued on the basis of valuations, as at the Balance Sheet date, carried out by an independent actuary using Projected 
Unit Credit Method. Actuarial gains and losses comprise experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss. The Company presents the provision for compensated absences under provisions in the Balance Sheet. 
3.16.3 
Employee Stock Option & Employee Stock Appreciation Right 
The Company has formulated its Employees Stock Option Schemes and Stock Appreciation Right Schemes (SAR). The fair value of options granted under Employee Stock Option Plan is 
recognised as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in Provisions and the fair value of SAR granted is recognized as an employee benefit expense having a corresponding 
increase in financial liability. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the 
period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.  
3.17 Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the enterprise determines the level of provision by discounting the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific 
to the liability. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.

3.18  Taxes 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
3.18.1 Current Tax 
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of taxable profit for a period. Taxable profit differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss because 
of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws.  
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of reporting date in India where the Company operates and generates 
taxable income. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
3.18.2 Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income tax is determined 
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is probable that future taxable amounts will arise to utilise those temporary 
differences and losses. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit and loss is recognised either in other comprehensive income or in equity. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on 
the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities are realised simultaneously. 
3.18.3 Goods and services tax /value added taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses 
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the goods and services tax/value added taxes paid, except: 
i.
When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the
asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable
ii. When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included
The net amount of tax recoverable from and / or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables respectively in the balance sheet.

3.19 Contingent Liabilities and assets 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond 
the control of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also 
arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its 
existence in the ﬁnancial statements. 
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be conﬁrmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not 
wholly within the control of the entity. The company does not have any contingent assets in the ﬁnancial statements. 
3.20 Earnings Per Share 
The Company reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable 
to equity shareholders (after deducting preference dividend and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted 
for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have been issued at a later date. In 
computing the dilutive earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that either reduces the earnings per share or increases loss per share are included. 
3.21 Dividends on ordinary shares 
The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders of the Company when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion 
of the Company. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. 
Non-cash distributions are measured at the fair value of the assets to be distributed with fair value re-measurement recognised directly in equity. 
Upon distribution of non-cash assets, any difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the carrying amount of the assets distributed is recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss. 
3.22 Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement 
is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
Company as a lessee 
The Company’s lease asset class consist of building and equipment. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company has, at the date of transition, recognized a right-of use asset 
and a corresponding lease liability for all active lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short term lease) and low value assets. For these 
short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.  
The right-of-use assets are recognized at cost, which comprises the present value of the lease liability as at the date of transition. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the balance lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease 
F 308


# Page 491
payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit on the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates. Interest accrued on lease liability and lease payments 
made, are subsequently adjusted to the initial recognition of lease liability. 
Company as a lessor 
Leases where the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased items are operating leases. Rental Income arising from operating leases 
is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss.  
3.23 Cash flow statement 
Cash flows are reported using indirect method, whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash 
receipts or payments and items of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from regular revenue generating (operating activities), investing and 
financing activities of the Company are segregated.

Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the 
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. 
In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognized 
in the ﬁnancial statements is included in the following notes: 
4.1 
Business Model Assessment 
Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The Company determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups 
of financial assets are managed together to achieve a business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the performance of the assets is 
evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Company 
monitors financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity to understand the reason for their disposal 
and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for which the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Company’s continuous assessment of whether the business model 
for which the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the 
classification of those assets. 
4.2 
Deﬁned employee beneﬁt assets and liabilities 
The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions 
that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the 
valuation and its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
F 309


# Page 492
4.3 
Fair value measurement: 
When the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using 
various valuation techniques. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair 
values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of ﬁnancial 
instruments. 
4.4 
Impairment of financial assets 
The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when 
determining impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by several factors, changes in which can result in different levels of allowances. 
It has been the Company’s policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience, regulatory advisories, market conditions and forecasts and revise when necessary.  
4.5 
Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method 
The Company’s EIR methodology, recognises interest income / expense using a rate of return that represents the best estimate of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of 
loans given / taken and recognises the effect of potentially different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments and penalty interest 
and charges). 
This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and life-cycle of the instruments, as well expected changes to India’s base rate and other fee 
income/expense that are integral parts of the instrument. 
4.6 
Other estimates: 
These include contingent liabilities, useful lives of tangible and intangible assets etc.

(vi) The Company had filed a Writ Petition before the Honourable High Court of Madras on 30th July, 2019 challenging the Order passed by the Income Tax
Settlement Commission, Chennai Bench abating the proceedings before it relating to the Settlement Application filed by the Company dated December 17,
2017 (“Settlement Application”); and praying for stay on proceedings initiated by the Joint Commissioner of Income Tax (OSD), Central Circle,
Thiruvananthapuram post abatement of proceedings by the Settlement Commission. The tax and interest due on the issues forming part of the Settlement
Application totaled to ₹ 7,406 lakh. The Settlement Application related to notices received under Section 147 of the Income Tax Act, as per which the income
chargeable to tax for the Financial Years 2011-12 to 2016-17 of MFL has not been assessed, and Section 153A of the Income Tax Act, as per which MFL was
required to prepare true and correct return of which MFL was assessable for the Assessment Years 2011-2012 to 2016-2017. The Honourable High Court of
Madras has dismissed the petition filed by the Company on June 29, 2022 on the ground that the cause of action of the matter has arisen fully in Kerala and not
within the territorial jurisdiction of the honourable Madras High Court, thereby ousting its jurisdiction to entertain the petition. Accordingly, the Company has
filed a writ petition before the Honorable High Court of Kerala proceedings of which are ongoing.

The primary objective of the Company’s capital management policy is to ensure that the Company complies with externally imposed capital
requirements and maintains healthy credit ratings and capital ratios in order to support its business and to maximize shareholder value.
Being an NBFC-SI, the RBI requires the Company to maintain a minimum capital to risk weighted assets ratio ("CRAR") consisting of a
minimum Tier I Capital of 12% and a combined Tier I & Tier II Capital of 15% of our aggregate risk weighted assets. The capital
management process of the Company ensures to maintain a healthy CRAR at all the times. The Company has issued perpetual debt
instruments aggregating to INR 10,000 (March 31, 2022 - INR 13,500) during the year and had issued cumulative compulsorily convertible
preference shares aggregating to INR 15,000 during the previous year ended March 31, 2022 thereby strengthening the regulatory capital
levels.
Tier I Capital comprises of share capital, share premium, reserves, retained earnings including current year profits, cumulative compulsorily
convertible preference shares and perpetual debt instruments subject to permissible limits. Certain adjustments are made to Ind AS–based
results and reserves, in order to ensure compliance with the directions of the Reserve Bank of India. Tier II Capital consists primarily of
Subordinated Debt Instruments, subject to permissible limits as per the directions of the Reserve Bank of India and PDI in excess of 15% of
Tier I Capital of the Company as at the previous year.

Particulars
At FVTPL
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under
current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair values have been derived,
financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques.

Cumulative Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares (CCCPS)
The fair value of the CCCPS is measured using the Monte Carlo Simulation technique. The Monte Carlo Simulation Method is one where a risk-neutral framework is used to simulate a range of
simulated values, representing all the potential paths a variable could move over the period of the simulation. The inputs to this model are taken from observable market where possible, but where
this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is exercised in establishing fair values. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. 
The equity instruments which are actively traded on public stock exchanges with readily available active prices on a regular basis are classified as Level 1. Units held in mutual funds are
measured based on their published net asset value (NAV), taking into account redemption and/or other restrictions are generally Level 1. Equity instruments in non-listed entities are initially
recognised at transaction price and re-measured as per fair valuation report and valued as at the measurement date or at the nearest available date has been classified as Level 2.
For investment at fair value through profit and loss, valuation are done using quoted prices from active markets or on published Net Asset Values of the investment at the measurement date or at
the nearest available date. 
This level of hierarchy includes financial liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using
a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data, this
level of hierarchy includes cumulative compulsory convertible preference shares.

42 Segment Reporting
In accordance with Para 4 of IND AS 108, Operating Segments, segment information has been presented in the consolidated financial statements of Muthoot FinCorp Limited and therefore, no separate disclosure has
been given in standalone financial statement. 
Set out below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the financial statements. This table does not include the fair
values of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.
Particulars
Level
Carrying Value
Fair Value
For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts, which are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Such
instruments include: cash and balances, trade receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents and trade payables without a specific maturity. Such amounts have been classified as Level 3 on the basis that no
adjustments have been made to the balances in the balance sheet.
The fair values of loans and receivables are estimated by discounted cash flow models that incorporate assumptions for credit risks, probability of default and loss given default estimates. Since comparable data is not
available, credit risk is derived using historical experience, management view and other information used in its collective impairment models.
Fair values of portfolios are calculated using a portfolio-based approach, grouping loans as far as possible into homogenous groups based on similar characteristics ie, type of loan. The Company then calculates and
extrapolates the fair value to the entire portfolio using effective interest rate model that incorporate interest rate estimates considering all significant characteristics of the loans. The credit risk is applied as a top-side
adjustment based on the collective impairment model incorporating probability of defaults and loss given defaults. Hence, the carrying amount of such financial assets at amortised cost net of impairment loss allowance
is of reasonable approximation of their fair value.
The fair values of financial liability held-to-maturity are estimated using a effective interest rate model based on contractual cash flows using actual yields. Since the cost of borrowing on the reporting date is not
expected to be significantly different from the actual yield considered under effective interest rate model, the carrying value of financial liabilities at amortised cost is considered a reasonable approximation of their fair
value.

The Company has considered a financial instrument as 'cured' and therefore re-classified out of Stage 3 during the year only once the entire dues have been received.
Company's internal credit rating grades and staging criteria for  loans are as follows:
The Company is primarily engaged in the business of providing gold and SME loans. Whereas tenure of gold loans primarily range from 6 to 12 months, tenure of SME loans and loans against property range from 3 months to 180 months.
The Company addresses credit risk through following major processes:
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include
loans, investments, cash and cash equivalents and other receivables that derive directly from its operations. 
As a financial lending institution, Company is exposed to various risks that are related to lending business and operating environment. The principal objective in Company 's risk management processes is to measure and monitor the various risks that
Company is subject to and to follow policies and procedures to address such risks. 
The Company's Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors constituted in accordance with the RBI rules has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Risk Management Policy. The committee meets quarterly to
review the Risk Management practices and working of the Risk Management Department. The committee is chaired by an Independent Director. The Risk Management department periodically places its report to the committee for review. The
committee’s suggestions for improving the Risk Management Practices are implemented by the Risk Management department.  
The Company has implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to assess, monitor and manage risk throughout the Group. The risk management process is continuously reviewed, improved and adapted in the changing risk scenario and the
agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the changing risk landscape. The process of continuous evaluation of risks includes taking stock of the risk landscape on an event-driven basis. The Company
has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically addressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis.
The major type of risk Company faces in business are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk.
Credit Risk arises from the risk of loss that may occur from the default of Company's customers under loan agreements. Customer defaults and inadequate collateral may lead to loan losses.
- Standardize the process of identifying new risks and designing appropriate controls for these risks
- Minimize losses due to defaults or untimely payments by borrowers
- Maintain an appropriate credit administration and loan review system 
- Establish metrics for portfolio appraisal and monitoring
- Design appropriate credit risk mitigation techniques
The Company’s impairment assessment and measurement approach is set out in this note. It should be read in conjunction with the summary of significant accounting policies.
The Company considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.
As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Company also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such events occur, the Company carefully considers whether the event should result
in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations.

The table below shows the maturity pattern of the assets and liabilities:
The internal rating model evaluates the loans on an ongoing basis. The rating model also assesses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the previously assigned risk grade. One key factor that indicates significant increase in credit
risk is when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.
Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to raise necessary funds from the market at optimal cost to meet operational and debt servicing requirements. The purpose of liquidity management is to ensure sufficient cash flow to meet all financial
commitments and to capitalise on opportunities for business expansion. Board of Directors will have overall responsibility of monitoring, supervision and control of the Asset Liability Management (ALM) mechanism. Board will have a sub-committee
of Directors (ALM Committee) to review the ALM position of the Company on at least half yearly intervals. An Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) consisting of senior executives of the Company including the Managing Director shall be responsible
for the day to day as well as periodic monitoring and control of Asset Liability management. Our treasury team sources funds from multiple sources, including from banks, financial institutions, capital & retail markets to maintain a healthy mix of
sources. The treasury team is responsible for diversifying fund raising sources, managing interest rate risks and maintaining a strong relationship with banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies, other domestic and foreign
financial institutions and rating agencies to ensure the liquidity risk is well addressed.
The outstanding balance as at the reporting date is considered as EAD by the company.
The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. To calculate the ECL for a Stage 1 loan, the Company assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the calculation of the 12 month ECL. For
Stage 2 and Stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the instruments. The Company uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products, schemes, ticket
size, loan to value and geographies, the Company has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach considering fresh slippage using historical information. 
Based on its review of macro-economic developments and economic outlook, the Company has assessed that no adjustment is required for temporary overlays to determine qualitative impact on its PD.
The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Company expects to receive. LGD rates for Gold Loans
have been computed internally based on the discounted recoveries in NPA accounts that are closed/ auctioned and upgraded during the year. For other loans, LGD rates have been arrived at guided by the Foundational Internal Ratings Based approach
(FIRB) norms.
When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Company applies the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

c) Prepayment risk
Operational and business risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Company will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment earlier or later than expected.
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to operate effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial
loss. The Company cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but it endeavours to manage these risks through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access,
authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, such as the use of internal audit.
Market Risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market factor. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the interest rates and other
market changes. The Company is exposed to three types of market risk as follows:
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is subject to interest rate risk, principally because we lend to clients at fixed interest rates and for
periods that may differ from our funding sources, while our borrowings are at both fixed and variable interest rates for different periods. We assess and manage our interest rate risk by managing our assets and liabilities. Our Asset Liability
Management Committee evaluates asset liability management, and ensures that all significant mismatches, if any, are being managed appropriately.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion of  borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the profit before taxes affected through the impact on floating rate 
borrowings is as follows:
Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decreases as the result of changes in level of equity indices and individual stocks.  The trading and non-trading equity price risk  exposure arises from equity securities classified at FVOCI”. A
10% increase/(decrease) in the equity price (traded and non-traded) would have the impact as follows:
A sudden fall in the gold price can result in increased customers defaults where the loan amount and interest exceeds the market value of gold, though the sentimental value of the gold jewellery to the customers may induce repayment and redemption
of the collateral. This risk is partly mitigated by the fact that a minimum 25% margin is retained on the value of gold jewellery for the purpose of calculation of the loan amount. Further, the gold jewellery collateral is appraised solely based on the
weight of its gold content, excluding weight and value of the stone studded in the jewellery if any. Though an occasional decrease in gold prices will not increase price risk significantly on account of our adequate collateral security margins, a
sustained decrease in the market price of gold can additionally cause a decrease in the size of our loan portfolio and our interest income.

3. Significant accounting policies
3.1 
Recognition of interest income
Interest income is recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial assets other than credit-impaired assets and financial assets classified as
measured at FVTPL.
 The EIR in case of a financial asset is computed: 
a.
As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset.
b.
By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.
c.
Including all fees received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.
Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets. Interest income is not 
recognized on credit impaired assets. 
3.2   Recognition of revenue from sale of goods and services 
Revenue (other than for financial instruments) is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers outlines a single 
comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance found within Ind ASs. 
The Company recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in Ind AS 115: 
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every 
contract that must be met. 
Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. 
Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services 
to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. 
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to 
each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. 
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation 
Revenue from contract with customer for rendering services is recognised at a point in time when performance obligation is satisfied.

3.2.1 
Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and 
the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably. 
3.2.2 
Rental Income 
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss, unless the increase 
is in line with expected general inflation, in which case lease income is recognised based on contractual terms. 
3.2.3 
Fees and commission income 
Fees and commission income such as service charges, commission from fee based business lines, service income etc. are recognised on point in time basis. 
3.2.4 
Net gain on fair value changes 
The Company designates certain financial assets for subsequent measurement at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The 
Company recognises gains on fair value change of financial assets measured at FVTPL on net basis. 
3.2.5 
Net gain on derecognition of financial instruments 
Gains arising out of direct assignment transactions comprise the difference between the interest on the loan portfolio and the applicable rate at which the direct assignment is entered into with 
the assignee, also known as the excess interest spread (EIS).  
3.3 Financial instruments 
1.1.1. Initial recognition 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition 
of the financial asset. 
Loans are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account. Investments are recognised on settlement date. The Company recognises debt securities and borrowings when funds 
reach the Company, post allotment if applicable. 
1.1.2. Initial and subsequent measurement of financial instruments 
The Company classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: 
1.
Debt instruments at amortised cost
2.
Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
3.
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
4.
Equity instruments in subsidiary companies at cost
5.
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI
The classification depends on the contractual terms of the financial assets’ cash flows and the Company’s business model for managing financial assets which are explained below: 
Business model assessment 
The Company determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective. 
F 401


# Page 584
The Company's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as: 
► How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity's key management personnel
► The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and the way those risks are managed
► How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected)
► The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Company’s assessment. The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without
taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Company's original expectations, the Company
does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased
financial assets going forward.
The SPPI test 
As a second step of its classification process, the Company assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. 
 ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments 
of principal or amortisation of the premium/discount). 
In making this assessment, the Company considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value 
of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are 
inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
The Company classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through the profit and loss account or is required to measure liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss such as derivative liabilities. 
1.1.3. Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement at fair value plus directly attributable costs, these financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised 
cost is calculated by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in interest income in the profit or 
loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in statement of profit and loss. 
F 402


# Page 585
1.1.4. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and selling the assets and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding
Debt instruments included within the FVOCI category are measured at each reporting date at fair value with such changes being recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI). The interest 
income on these assets is recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses or reversals, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Upon disposal, the 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement.  
1.1.5. Financial Instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments that meet the amortised cost 
criteria or the FVTOCI criteria but are designated as at FVTPL are measured at FVTPL. 
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVOCI criteria may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition, if such designation eliminates 
or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases. 
Company’s investment is classified as FVTPL, if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial 
instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of short-term profit taking. 
Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value, with transaction costs recognised in the income statement as incurred. Subsequently, they are 
measured at fair value and any gains or losses are recognised in the income statement as they arise.  
1.1.6. Equity instruments 
The Company subsequently measures investment in equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, unless the Company’s management has elected to classify irrevocably some of its 
equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI, when such instruments meet the definition of definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for 
trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Gains and losses on these equity instruments classified at FVOCI are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised in profit or loss as dividend income when the right of the payment 
has been established, except when the Company benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI.  
3.3.1  Financial Liabilities 
Initial Measurement 
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition or the issue of financial liability, which are not at fair value through 
profit or loss, are adjusted to fair value at initial recognition. 
F 403


# Page 586
Subsequent Measurement  
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
3.4 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
3.4.1 Financial Asset 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from 
the financial asset have expired. The Company also derecognises the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.  
The Company has transferred the financial asset if, and only if, either: 
a)
The Company has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset
or
b)
It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass–
through’ arrangement
Pass-through arrangements are transactions whereby the Company retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of a financial asset (the 'original asset'), but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more entities (the 'eventual recipients'), when all of the following three conditions are met: 
► The Company has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it has collected equivalent amounts from the original asset, excluding short-term
advances with the right to full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued interest at market rates
► The Company cannot sell or pledge the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients
► The Company has to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay. In addition, the Company is not entitled to reinvest such
cash flows, except for investments in cash or cash equivalents including interest earned, during the period between the collection date and the date of required remittance
to the eventual recipients.
A transfer only qualifies for derecognition if either: 
► The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or,
► The Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset
► The Company considers control to be transferred if and only if, the transferee has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is
able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without imposing additional restrictions on the transfer.
When the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and has retained control of the asset, the asset continues to be recognised 
only to the extent of the Company’s continuing involvement, in which case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained. 
F 404


# Page 587
3.4.2 Financial Liability 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender 
on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as de recognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. 
3.5 Offsetting 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when the 
Company has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously in all the following circumstances: 
a.
The normal course of business
b.
The event of default
c.
The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company and/or its counter parties.
3.6 Impairment of financial assets 
3.6.1 
Overview of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) principles 
The Company has created provisions on all financial assets wherever required, except for financial assets classified as FVTPL, based on the expected credit loss method. 
The ECL provision is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since 
origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss. The 12-month ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs that result from default 
events on financial assets that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. 
The Company performs an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the 
change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. 
Based on the above process, the Company categorises its loans into three stages as described below: 
For non-impaired financial instruments 

Stage 1 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have not experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. A 12-month ECL provision
is made for stage 1 financial instruments. In assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument
as at the reporting date, with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition.

Stage 2 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have experienced a SICR since initial recognition. The Company recognises lifetime ECL for stage 2 financial
instruments. In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit risk of the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a SICR since initial recognition, then entities recognize
12 months of ECL.
For impaired financial instruments: 
Financial instruments are classified as stage 3 when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more loss events that have occurred after initial recognition with a negative 
F 405


# Page 588
impact on the estimated future cash flows of a loan or a portfolio of loans. The Company recognises lifetime ECL for impaired financial instruments. 
3.6.2 
The calculation of ECLs 
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows: 
Probability of Default (PD) - The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. 
The Company uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products, schemes, ticket size, loan to value and geographies, the Company has bifurcated 
its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach considering fresh slippage using historical information.  
Exposure at Default (EAD) - The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including 
repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.  
Loss Given Default (LGD) – The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual 
cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive.  
Forward looking information 
While estimating the expected credit losses, the Company reviews macro-economic developments occurring in the economy and market it operates in. On a periodic basis, the Company analyses 
if there is any relationship between key economic trends like GDP, unemployment rates, benchmark rates set by the Reserve Bank of India, inﬂation etc. with the estimate of PD, LGD determined 
by the Company based on its internal data. While the internal estimates of PD, LGD rates by the Company may not be always reﬂective of such relationships, temporary overlays, if any, are 
embedded in the methodology to reﬂect such macro-economic trends reasonably. 
Write-offs 
Loans are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when it is determined that the customer does not have assets or sources 
of income that could generate sufﬁcient cash ﬂows to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are credited to the statement of proﬁt and loss. 
Collateral 
To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Company seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in various forms, such as gold, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, 
stock, current asset etc. However, the fair value of collateral affects the calculation of ECLs. The fair value of the same is based on data provided by third party or management judgements. 
Impairment of Trade receivables 
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance 
on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables. 
3.7 Determination of fair value 
The Company measures financial instruments, such as, investments at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
F 406


# Page 589
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement 
is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
i.
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
ii.
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, if market participants act in their economic best 
interest. 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. 
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which enough data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
The financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as summarised below: 
Level 1 financial instruments − Those where the inputs used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has access to at 
the measurement date. The Company considers markets as active only if there are sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical assets or liabilities and 
when there are binding and exercisable price quotes available on the balance sheet date. 
Level 2 financial instruments − Those where the inputs that are used for valuation and are significant, are derived from directly or indirectly observable market data available over the entire 
period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets and observable inputs 
other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit spreads. In addition, adjustments may be required for the condition or location of the asset or the 
extent to which it relates to items that are comparable to the valued instrument. However, if such adjustments are based on unobservable inputs which are significant to the entire measurement, 
the Company will classify the instruments as Level 3. 
Level 3 financial instruments − Those that include one or more unobservable input that is signiﬁcant to the measurement as whole. 
3.8 Foreign Currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies, if any, are initially recorded in the functional currency at the spot rate of ex-change ruling at the date of the transaction. However, for practical reasons, the 
Company uses an average rate if the average approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. All differences arising on non–
trading activities are taken to other income/expense in the statement of profit and loss.  
Non–monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rates as at the date of recognition. 
F 407


# Page 590
3.9 Finance cost 
Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial liabilities other than financial liabilities classified as 
FVTPL. 
Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognized as part of the carrying value of the financial liability and amortized over the expected life using the effective interest method. 
These include fees including upfront costs incurred in relation to borrowings, commissions payable to advisers and other expenses such as external legal costs, provided these are incremental 
costs that are directly related to the issue of a financial liability. Interest accrued on lease liability recognized and measured in accordance with Ind AS 116 “Leases” also forms part of Finance 
cost. 
3.10 Other income and expenses  
All Other income and expense are recognized in the period they occur. 
3.11  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand, short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less and forex balances, which are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short- term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts, if any, as they are 
considered an integral part of the Company’s cash management. 
3.12   Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, (if any). The total cost of assets comprises its purchase price, freight, 
duties, taxes and any other incidental expenses directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the 
management.  
Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible asset are added to its gross value only if it increases the future benefits of the existing asset, beyond its previously assessed standards of 
performance and cost can be measured reliably. Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed off as and when incurred. 
3.12.1 
Depreciation 
Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended 
use.  
Depreciation is charged based on a review by the management during the year and at the rates derived based on the useful lives of the assets as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 
2013 on Straight Line Method.   
F 408


# Page 591
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Particulars 
Useful life 
Buildings 
60 years 
Computer 
3 years 
Furniture and Fixtures 
5 to 30 years 
Plant and Equipment 
5 to 20 years 
Vehicles 
5 to 8 years  
Windmill 
22 years 
Office equipment 
15 years 
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
Property plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the year the asset is derecognised. The date of disposal of 
an item of property, plant and equipment is the date the recipient obtains control of that item in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in 
Ind AS 115. 
3.13    Intangible assets 
The Company’s intangible assets consist of computer software. 
An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the Company. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure on making 
the asset ready for its intended use and net of any trade discounts and rebates. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised using the Written down value method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets 
comprising of software are amortised on a Written down value basis over a period of 3 years keeping residual value 5%. 
Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. 
3.14   Investment Property 
Properties, held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation are classified as investment property and measured and reported at cost, including transaction costs, borrowing cost and other directly 
attributable cost in bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that the future 
economic benefit associated with the expenditure will flow to the company.

# Page 592
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any 
gain or loss arising on derecognition of property is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the same period. 
The fair value of investment property is disclosed in the notes accompanying these financial statements. Fair value has been determined by an independent valuer who holds a recognised and 
relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued. 
3.15 Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Company’s assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, 
the Company estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in 
use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When 
the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are considered. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation 
model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, 
the Company estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit 
or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. 
3.16 Post-employment benefits 
3.16.1 Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to the Employees Provident Fund Scheme maintained by the Central Government, Employee State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) etc. are accounted for on an accrual basis. 
Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined contribution scheme.  
The company has no obligation, other than the contribution payable under the schemes. The company recognizes contribution payable to the provident fund scheme / ESIC as expenditure, when 
an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme / ESIC for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit 
payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the 
balance sheet date, then excess is recognized as an asset. 
3.16.2 
Defined Benefit schemes 
Gratuity 
The Company provides for gratuity covering eligible employees under which a lumpsum payment is paid to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, 
of an amount reckoned on the respective employee’s salary and his tenor of employment with the Company. The Company accounts for its liability for future gratuity benefits based on actuarial 
valuation determined at each Balance Sheet date by an Independent Actuary using Projected Unit Credit Method. The Company makes contributions to a Gratuity Fund administered by the Life 
Insurance Corporation of India.  
F 410


# Page 593
The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan are based 
on the market yields on Government Securities as at the Balance Sheet date.     
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases 
and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed 
at each reporting date. 
Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability), are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with 
a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassiﬁed to proﬁt and loss in subsequent periods. 
3.17 Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the enterprise determines the level of provision by discounting the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific 
to the liability. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. 
3.18  Taxes 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
3.18.1 Current Tax 
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of taxable profit for a period. Taxable profit differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss because 
of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws.  
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of reporting date in India where the Company operates and generates 
taxable income. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
3.18.2 Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income tax is determined 
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is probable that future taxable amounts will arise to utilise those temporary 
differences and losses. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
F 411


# Page 594
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit and loss is recognised either in other comprehensive income or in equity. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on 
the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities are realised simultaneously. 
3.18.3 Goods and services tax /value added taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses 
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the goods and services tax/value added taxes paid, except: 
i.
When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the
asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable
ii. When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included
The net amount of tax recoverable from and / or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables respectively in the balance sheet. 
3.19 Contingent Liabilities and assets 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond 
the control of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also 
arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its 
existence in the ﬁnancial statements. 
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be conﬁrmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not 
wholly within the control of the entity. The company does not have any contingent assets in the ﬁnancial statements. 
3.20 Earnings Per Share 
The Company reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable 
to equity shareholders (after deducting preference dividend and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted 
for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have been issued at a later date. In 
computing the dilutive earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that either reduces the earnings per share or increases loss per share are included. 
3.21 Dividends on ordinary shares 
The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders of the Company when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion 
of the Company. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. 
Non-cash distributions are measured at the fair value of the assets to be distributed with fair value re-measurement recognised directly in equity. 
F 412


# Page 595
Upon distribution of non-cash assets, any difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the carrying amount of the assets distributed is recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss. 
3.22 Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement 
is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
Company as a lessee 
The Company’s lease asset class consist of building, equipment and vehicles. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a 
lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company has, at the date of transition, recognized a right-of 
use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all active lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short term lease) and low value assets. 
For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.  
The right-of-use assets are recognized at cost, which comprises the present value of the lease liability as at the date of transition. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the balance lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease 
payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit on the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates. Interest accrued on lease liability and lease payments 
made, are subsequently adjusted to the initial recognition of lease liability. 
Company as a lessor 
Leases where the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased items are operating leases. Rental Income arising from operating leases 
is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss.  
3.23 Cash flow statement 
Cash flows are reported using indirect method, whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash 
receipts or payments and items of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from regular revenue generating (operating activities), investing and 
financing activities of the Company are segregated. 
4 
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the 
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. 
In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognized 
in the ﬁnancial statements is included in the following notes: 
F 413

4.1 
Business Model Assessment 
Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The Company determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups 
of financial assets are managed together to achieve a business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the performance of the assets is 
evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Company 
monitors financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity to understand the reason for their disposal 
and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for which the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Company’s continuous assessment of whether the business model 
for which the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the 
classification of those assets. 
4.2 
Deﬁned employee beneﬁt assets and liabilities 
The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions 
that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the 
valuation and its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
4.3 
Fair value measurement: 
When the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using 
various valuation techniques. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair 
values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of ﬁnancial 
instruments. 
4.4 
Impairment of financial assets 
The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when 
determining impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by several factors, changes in which can result in different levels of allowances. 
It has been the Company’s policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience, regulatory advisories, market conditions and forecasts and revise when necessary.  
4.5 
Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method 
The Company’s EIR methodology, recognises interest income / expense using a rate of return that represents the best estimate of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of 
loans given / taken and recognises the effect of potentially different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments and penalty interest 
and charges). 
This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and life-cycle of the instruments, as well expected changes to India’s base rate and other fee 
income/expense that are integral parts of the instrument. 
4.6 
Other estimates: 
These include contingent liabilities, useful lives of tangible and intangible assets etc.

The following table shows an analysis of financial instruments recorded at fair value by level of the fair value hierarchy as at March 31, 2021:
Particulars
At FVTPL
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under
current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair values have been derived,
financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques.

The fair value of the CCCPS is measured using the Monte Carlo Simulation technique. The Monte Carlo Simulation Method is one where a risk-neutral framework is used to simulate a range of
simulated values, representing all the potential paths a variable could move over the period of the simulation. The inputs to this model are taken from observable market where possible, but where
this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is exercised in establishing fair values. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. 
The equity instruments which are actively traded on public stock exchanges with readily available active prices on a regular basis are classified as Level 1. Units held in mutual funds are
measured based on their published net asset value (NAV), taking into account redemption and/or other restrictions are generally Level 1. Equity instruments in non-listed entities are initially
recognised at transaction price and re-measured as per fair valuation report and valued as at the measurement date or at the nearest available date has been classified as Level 2.
For investment at fair value through profit and loss, valuation are done using quoted prices from active markets or on published Net Asset Values of the investment at the measurement date or at
the nearest available date. 
This level of hierarchy includes financial liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using
a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data, this
level of hierarchy includes cumulative compulsory convertible preference shares.

42 Segment Reporting
The fair values of loans and receivables are estimated by discounted cash flow models that incorporate assumptions for credit risks, probability of default and loss given default estimates. Since comparable data is not
available, credit risk is derived using historical experience, management view and other information used in its collective impairment models.
Fair values of portfolios are calculated using a portfolio-based approach, grouping loans as far as possible into homogenous groups based on similar characteristics ie, type of loan. The Company then calculates and
extrapolates the fair value to the entire portfolio using Effective interest rate model that incorporate interest rate estimates considering all significant characteristics of the loans. The credit risk is applied as a top-side
adjustment based on the collective impairment model incorporating probability of defaults and loss given defaults. Hence, the carrying amount of such financial assets at amortised cost net of impairment loss allowance
is of reasonable approximation of their fair value.
The fair values of financial liability held-to-maturity are estimated using a effective interest rate model based on contractual cash flows using actual yields. Since the cost of borrowing on the reporting date is not
expected to be significantly different from the actual yield considered under effective interest rate model, the carrying value of financial liabilities at amortised cost is considered a reasonable approximation of their fair
value.
In accordance with Para 4 of IND AS 108, Operating Segments, segment information has been presented in the consolidated financial statements of Muthoot FinCorp Limited and therefore, no separate disclosure has
been given in standalone financial statement. 
Set out below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the financial statements. This table does not include the fair
values of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.

Fair Value
For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts, which are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Such
instruments include: cash and balances, Trade receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents and trade payables without a specific maturity. Such amounts have been classified as Level 3 on the basis that no
adjustments have been made to the balances in the balance sheet.

The Company addresses credit risk through following major processes:
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include
loans, investments, cash and cash equivalents and other receivables that derive directly from its operations. 
As a financial lending institution, Company is exposed to various risks that are related to lending business and operating environment. The principal objective in Company 's risk management processes is to measure and monitor the various risks that
Company is subject to and to follow policies and procedures to address such risks. 
The Company's Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors constituted in accordance with the RBI rules has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Risk Management Policy. The committee meets quarterly to
review the Risk Management practices and working of the Risk Management Department. The committee is chaired by an Independent Director. The Risk Management department periodically places its report to the committee for review. The
committee’s suggestions for improving the Risk Management Practices are implemented by the Risk Management department.  
The Company has implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to assess, monitor and manage risk throughout the Group. The risk management process is continuously reviewed, improved and adapted in the changing risk scenario and the
agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the changing risk landscape. The process of continuous evaluation of risks includes taking stock of the risk landscape on an event-driven basis. The Company
has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically addressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis.
The major type of risk Company faces in business are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk.
Credit Risk arises from the risk of loss that may occur from the default of Company's customers under loan agreements. Customer defaults and inadequate collateral may lead to higher NPAs.
- Standardize the process of identifying new risks and designing appropriate controls for these risks
- Minimize losses due to defaults or untimely payments by borrowers
- Maintain an appropriate credit administration and loan review system 
- Establish metrics for portfolio appraisal and monitoring
- Design appropriate credit risk mitigation techniques
The Company’s impairment assessment and measurement approach is set out in this note. It should be read in conjunction with the Summary of significant accounting policies.
The Company considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.
As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Company also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such events occur, the Company carefully considers whether the event should result
in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate.
It is the Company’s policy to consider a financial instrument as ‘cured’ and therefore re-classified out of Stage 3 when none of the default criteria have been present for at least three consecutive months. The decision whether to classify an asset as
Stage 2 or Stage 1 once cured depends on the updated credit grade, at the time of the cure, and whether this indicates there has been a significant increase in credit risk compared to initial recognition. 
Company's internal credit rating grades and staging criteria for  loans are as follows:

| High grade | Not yet due | Stage I |

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company may not meet its financial obligations. Liquidity risk arises due to the unavailability of adequate funds at an appropriate cost or tenure. The objective of liquidity risk management, is to maintain
sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Company consistently generates sufficient cash flows from operating and financial activities to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. Our
resource mobilisation team sources funds from multiple sources, including from banks, financial institutions, capital & retail markets to maintain a healthy mix of sources. The resource mobilisation team is responsible for diversifying fund raising
sources, managing interest rate risks and maintaining a strong relationship with banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies, other domestic and foreign financial institutions and rating agencies to ensure the liquidity risk is well
addressed.
The outstanding balance as at the reporting date is considered as EAD by the company.
The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. To calculate the ECL for a Stage 1 loan, the Company assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the calculation of the 12mECL. For Stage
2 and Stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the instruments. The Company uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products, schemes, ticket size,
loan to value and geographies, the Company has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach considering fresh slippage using historical information. 
The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Company expects to receive. LGD Rates for Gold
Loans have been computed internally based on the discounted recoveries in NPA accounts that are closed/ written off/ repossessed and upgraded during the year. For other loans, LGD rates have been arrived at guided by the Foundational Internal
Ratings Based approach (FIRB) norms.
When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Company applies the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
Significant Increase in credit risk
The internal rating model evaluates the loans on an ongoing basis. The rating model also assesses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the previously assigned risk grade. One key factor that indicates significant increase in credit
risk is when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.
The table below shows the maturity pattern of the assets and liabilities:

Prepayment risk
Operational and business risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Company will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment earlier or later than expected.
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to operate effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial 
loss. The Company cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but it endeavours to manage these risks through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access, 
authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, such as the use of internal audit.
Market Risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market factor. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the interest rates and other
market changes. The Company is exposed to two types of market risk as follows:
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is subject to interest rate risk, principally because we lend to clients at fixed interest rates and for
periods that may differ from our funding sources, while our borrowings are at both fixed and variable interest rates for different periods. We assess and manage our interest rate risk by managing our assets and liabilities. Our Asset Liability
Management Committee evaluates asset liability management, and ensures that all significant mismatches, if any, are being managed appropriately.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion of  borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the profit before taxes affected through the impact on floating rate 
borrowings is as follows:
Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decreases as the result of changes in level of equity indices and individual stocks.  The trading and non-trading equity price risk  exposure arises from equity securities classified at FVOCI”. A 
10% increase/(decrease) in the equity price (traded and non-traded) would have the impact as follows:

The after effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant restrictions have continued to have its impact on economic activity during the year ended March 31, 2022. However, this has not
resulted in a significant impact on the operations / financial position of the Company, though there has been an expected level of stress in collections and higher gold auctions during the year.
With reduced probability of restrictions even in times of Covid spikes thereby allowing continuity of general economic momentum, the future performances and collections are expected to
improve. 
In the opinion of the management, the impairment loss allowance as stated in Note 8 is considered adequate to cover any future uncertainties on account of the above.

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements 
Opinion 
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements of Muthoot 
FinCorp Limited, Muthoot Centre, Punnen Road, Trivandrum - 695039 (herein after 
referred to as."the Company"), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2021, the 
Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of 
Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, including the notes 
to the Ind AS Financial Statements, a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information ("Ind AS Financial Statements"). 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, 
the aforesaid Ind AS Financial Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013 ('the Act') in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 
March 31, 2021, and its profit including other comprehensive income, changes in equity and 
cash flows for the year ended on that date. 
Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under 
section 143 (10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our responsibilities under those Standards are 
further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of 
Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of 
the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. 
Emphasis of Matter 
We draw attention to Note 44 to the standalone Ind AS financial statements, relating to the 
impact of Covid-19 Pandemic. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

(b) IT Systems and Controls
The Company's key financial accounting 
and reporting processes are highly 
dependent on the automated controls in 
information systems. We have considered 
this as Key Audit Matter as any control 
lapses, incorrect input data and wrong 
extraction of data may result in the 
financial accounting and reporting records 
being misstated.

We tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of key controls over user 
access management which includes 
granting access right, new user creation, 
removal of user rights and preventative 
controls designed to enforce segregation 
of duties. 
Based on our review no weakness was 
found in the IT Systems and Controls. 
Information other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report thereon 
The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the 
financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Annual Report is expected to be 
made available to us after the date of this auditor's report. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, 
we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Ind AS 
Financial Statements 
The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the 
Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these Ind AS Financial Statements that 
give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, changes in equity and 
cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act. This 
responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with 
the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and 
detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the 
Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors 
either intends·to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so. 
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the company's financial reporting 
process. 
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the
Companies Act, 2013, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the
company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating
effectiveness of such controls.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including
the disclosures, and whether the Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial statements that, individually or 
in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and 
qualitative factors in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our 
work; and to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements. 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope_ and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.

Annexure B to Independent Auditors' Report 
Referred to in paragraph 2(f) under 'Report on other legal and regulatory requirements' 
of the Independent Auditors' Report of even date to the members of Muthoot FinCorp 
Limited on the Ind AS Financial Statements as of and for the year ended 31 March 2 021 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 
of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act"): 
Opinion 
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Muthoot FinCorp 
Limited ("the Company") as of March 31, 2021 in conjunction with our audit of the Ind AS 
Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. 
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial 
reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2021, based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditors' Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over 
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance 
Note") and the Standards on Auditing, both issued by the ICAI and deemed to be prescribed 
under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established 
and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. 
F 486


# Page 669
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of 
the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system over financial 
reporting. 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those 
policies and procedures that; (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements. 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.

Basis of measurement 
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for following assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value: 
i)
Investments in equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or at fair value through statement of profit or loss (FVTPL)
ii)
Investments which are held for trading
iii)
Defined benefit plans.
Functional and presentation currency 
The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR) which is also functional currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company 
operates. All values are rounded to the nearest lakhs, except when otherwise indicated.  
3. Significant accounting policies
3.1 
Recognition of interest income 
Interest income is recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial assets other than credit-impaired assets and financial assets classified as 
measured at FVTPL. 
 The EIR in case of a financial asset is computed: 
a.
As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset.
b.
By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.
c.
Including all fees received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.
 Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets. 
Interest income on credit impaired assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the net amortised cost (net of provision) of the financial asset. 
3.2   Recognition of revenue from sale of goods and services 
Revenue (other than for financial instruments) is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers outlines a single 
comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance found within Ind ASs. 
The Company recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in Ind 115: 
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every 
contract that must be met. 
Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. 
F 493


# Page 676
Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services 
to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. 
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to 
each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. 
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation 
Revenue from contract with customer for rendering services is recognised at a point in time when performance obligation is satisfied. 
3.2.1 
Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and 
the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably. 
3.2.2 
Rental Income 
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss, unless the increase 
is in line with expected general inflation, in which case lease income is recognised based on contractual terms. 
3.2.3 
Fees and commission income 
Fees and commission income such as service charges, commission from fee based business lines, service income etc. are recognised on point in time basis. 
3.2.4 
Net gain on fair value changes 
The Company designates certain financial assets for subsequent measurement at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The 
Company recognises gains on fair value change of financial assets measured at FVTPL on net basis. 
3.2.5 
Net gain on derecognition of financial instruments 
Gains arising out of direct assignment transactions comprise the difference between the interest on the loan portfolio and the applicable rate at which the direct assignment is entered into with 
the assignee, also known as the excess interest spread (EIS).  
3.3 Financial instruments 
1.1.1. Initial recognition 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition 
of the financial asset. 
Loans are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account. Investments are recognised on settlement date. The Company recognises debt securities and borrowings when funds 
reach the Company, post allotment if applicable. 
F 494


# Page 677
1.1.2. Initial and subsequent measurement of financial instruments 
The Company classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: 
1.
Debt instruments at amortised cost
2.
Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
3.
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
4.
Equity instruments in subsidiary companies at cost
5.
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI
The classification depends on the contractual terms of the financial assets’ cash flows and the Company’s business model for managing financial assets which are explained below: 
Business model assessment 
The Company determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective. 
The Company's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as: 
► How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity's key management personnel
► The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and the way those risks are managed
► How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected)
► The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Company’s assessment. The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without
taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Company's original expectations, the Company
does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased
financial assets going forward.
The SPPI test 
As a second step of its classification process, the Company assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. 
 ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments 
of principal or amortisation of the premium/discount). 
In making this assessment, the Company considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value 
of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are 
inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
F 495


# Page 678
The Company classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through the profit and loss account or is required to measure liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss such as derivative liabilities. 
1.1.3. Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement at fair value plus directly attributable costs, these financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised 
cost is calculated by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in interest income in the profit or 
loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in statement of profit and loss. 
1.1.4. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and selling the assets and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding
Debt instruments included within the FVOCI category are measured at each reporting date at fair value with such changes being recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI). The interest 
income on these assets is recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses or reversals, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Upon disposal, the 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement.  
1.1.5. Financial Instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments that meet the amortised cost 
criteria or the FVTOCI criteria but are designated as at FVTPL are measured at FVTPL. 
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVOCI criteria may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition, if such designation eliminates 
or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases. 
Company’s investment is classified as FVTPL, if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial 
instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of short-term profit taking. 
Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value, with transaction costs recognised in the income statement as incurred. Subsequently, they are 
measured at fair value and any gains or losses are recognised in the income statement as they arise.  
F 496


# Page 679
1.1.6. Equity instruments 
The Company subsequently measures investment in equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, unless the Company’s management has elected to classify irrevocably some of its 
equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI, when such instruments meet the definition of definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for 
trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Gains and losses on these equity instruments classified at FVOCI are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised in profit or loss as dividend income when the right of the payment 
has been established, except when the Company benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI.  
3.3.1  Financial Liabilities 
Initial Measurement 
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition or the issue of financial liability, which are not at fair value through 
profit or loss, are adjusted to fair value at initial recognition. 
Subsequent Measurement  
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
3.4 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
3.4.1 Financial Asset 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from 
the financial asset have expired. The Company also derecognises the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.  
The Company has transferred the financial asset if, and only if, either: 
a)
The Company has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset
or
b)
It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass–
through’ arrangement
Pass-through arrangements are transactions whereby the Company retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of a financial asset (the 'original asset'), but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more entities (the 'eventual recipients'), when all of the following three conditions are met: 
► The Company has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it has collected equivalent amounts from the original asset, excluding short-term
advances with the right to full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued interest at market rates
F 497


# Page 680
► The Company cannot sell or pledge the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients
► The Company has to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay. In addition, the Company is not entitled to reinvest such
cash flows, except for investments in cash or cash equivalents including interest earned, during the period between the collection date and the date of required remittance
to the eventual recipients.
A transfer only qualifies for derecognition if either: 
► The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or,
► The Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset
► The Company considers control to be transferred if and only if, the transferee has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is
able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without imposing additional restrictions on the transfer.
When the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and has retained control of the asset, the asset continues to be recognised 
only to the extent of the Company’s continuing involvement, in which case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained. 
3.4.2 Financial Liability 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender 
on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as de recognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. 
3.5 Offsetting 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when the 
Company has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously in all the following circumstances: 
a.
The normal course of business
b.
The event of default
c.
The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company and/or its counter parties.
3.6 Impairment of financial assets 
3.6.1 
Overview of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) principles 
The Company has created provisions on all financial assets wherever required, except for financial assets classified as FVTPL, based on the expected credit loss method. 
F 498


# Page 681
The ECL provision is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since 
origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss. The 12-month ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs that result from default 
events on financial assets that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. 
The Company performs an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the 
change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. 
Based on the above process, the Company categorises its loans into three stages as described below: 
For non-impaired financial instruments 

Stage 1 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have not experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. A 12-month ECL provision
is made for stage 1 financial instruments. In assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument
as at the reporting date, with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition.

Stage 2 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have experienced a SICR since initial recognition. The Company recognises lifetime ECL for stage 2 financial
instruments. In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit risk of the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a SICR since initial recognition, then entities recognize
12 months of ECL.
For impaired financial instruments: 
Financial instruments are classified as stage 3 when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more loss events that have occurred after initial recognition with a negative 
impact on the estimated future cash flows of a loan or a portfolio of loans. The Company recognises lifetime ECL for impaired financial instruments. 
3.6.2 
The calculation of ECLs 
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows: 
Probability of Default (PD) - The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. 
The Company uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products, schemes, ticket size, loan to value and geographies, the Company has bifurcated 
its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach considering fresh slippage using historical information.  
Exposure at Default (EAD) - The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including 
repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.  
Loss Given Default (LGD) – The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual 
cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive.  
Forward looking information 
While estimating the expected credit losses, the Company reviews macro-economic developments occurring in the economy and market it operates in. On a periodic basis, the Company analyses 
if there is any relationship between key economic trends like GDP, unemployment rates, benchmark rates set by the Reserve Bank of India, inﬂation etc. with the estimate of PD, LGD determined 
F 499


# Page 682
by the Company based on its internal data. While the internal estimates of PD, LGD rates by the Company may not be always reﬂective of such relationships, temporary overlays, if any, are 
embedded in the methodology to reﬂect such macro-economic trends reasonably. 
Write-offs 
Loans are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when it is determined that the customer does not have assets or sources 
of income that could generate sufﬁcient cash ﬂows to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are credited to the statement of proﬁt and loss. 
Collateral 
To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Company seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in various forms, such as gold,  securities, letters of credit/guarantees, 
stock, current asset etc. However, the fair value of collateral affects the calculation of ECLs. The fair value of the same is based on data provided by third party or management judgements. 
Impairment of Trade receivables 
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance 
on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables. 
3.7 Determination of fair value 
The Company measures financial instruments, such as, investments at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement 
is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
i.
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
ii.
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, if market participants act in their economic best 
interest. 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. 
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which enough data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
The financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as summarised below: 
Level 1 financial instruments − Those where the inputs used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has access to at 
the measurement date. The Company considers markets as active only if there are sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical assets or liabilities and 
when there are binding and exercisable price quotes available on the balance sheet date. 
Level 2 financial instruments − Those where the inputs that are used for valuation and are significant, are derived from directly or indirectly observable market data available over the entire 
period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets and observable inputs 
F 500


# Page 683
other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit spreads. In addition, adjustments may be required for the condition or location of the asset or the 
extent to which it relates to items that are comparable to the valued instrument. However, if such adjustments are based on unobservable inputs which are significant to the entire measurement, 
the Company will classify the instruments as Level 3. 
Level 3 financial instruments − Those that include one or more unobservable input that is signiﬁcant to the measurement as whole. 
3.8 Foreign Currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the spot rate of ex-change ruling at the date of the transaction. However, for practical reasons, the Company 
uses an average rate if the average approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. All differences arising on non–
trading activities are taken to other income/expense in the statement of profit and loss.  
Non–monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rates as at the date of recognition. 
3.9 Finance cost 
Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial liabilities other than financial liabilities classified as 
FVTPL. 
Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognized as part of the carrying value of the financial liability and amortized over the expected life using the effective interest method. 
These include fees and commissions payable to advisers and other expenses such as external legal costs, provided these are incremental costs that are directly related to the issue of a financial 
liability. Interest accrued on lease liability recognized and measured in accordance with Ind AS 116 “Leases” also forms part of Finance cost. 
3.10 Other income and expenses  
All Other income and expense are recognized in the period they occur. 
3.11  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand, short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less and forex balances, which are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short- term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts, if any, as they are 
considered an integral part of the Company’s cash management. 
3.12   Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, (if any). The total cost of assets comprises its purchase price, freight, 
duties, taxes and any other incidental expenses directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the 
management.  
Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
F 501


# Page 684
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible asset are added to its gross value only if it increases the future benefits of the existing asset, beyond its previously assessed standards of 
performance and cost can be measured reliably. Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed off as and when incurred. 
3.12.1 
Depreciation 
Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended 
use.  
Depreciation is charged based on a review by the management during the year and at the rates derived based on the useful lives of the assets as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 
2013 on Straight Line Method.   
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Particulars 
Useful life 
Buildings 
60 years 
Computer 
3 years 
Furniture and Fixtures 
5 to 30 years 
Plant and Equipment 
5 to 20 years 
Vehicles 
5 to 8 years 
Windmill 
22 years 
Office equipment 
15 years 
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
Property plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the year the asset is derecognised. The date of disposal of 
an item of property, plant and equipment is the date the recipient obtains control of that item in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in 
Ind AS 115. 
3.13    Intangible assets 
The Company’s intangible assets consist of computer software. 
An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the Company. 
F 502


**Table from Page 684**

| Particulars | Useful life |
|---|---|
| Buildings | 60 years |
| Computer | 3 years |
| Furniture and Fixtures | 5 to 30 years |
| Plant and Equipment | 5 to 20 years |
| Vehicles | 5 to 8 years |
| Windmill | 22 years |
| Office equipment | 15 years |

# Page 685
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure on making 
the asset ready for its intended use and net of any trade discounts and rebates. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised using the Written down value method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets 
comprising of software are amortised on a Written down value basis over a period of 3 years keeping residual value 5%. 
Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. 
3.14   Investment Property 
Properties, held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation are classified as investment property and measured and reported at cost, including transaction costs, borrowing cost and other directly 
attributable cost in bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that the future 
economic benefit associated with the expenditure will flow to the company. 
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any 
gain or loss arising on derecognition of property is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the same period. 
The fair value of investment property is disclosed in the notes accompanying these financial statements. Fair value has been determined by an independent valuer who holds a recognised and 
relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued. 
3.15 Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Company’s assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, 
the Company estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in 
use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When 
the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are considered. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation 
model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, 
the Company estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit 
or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

3.16 Post-employment benefits 
3.16.1 Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to the Employees Provident Fund Scheme maintained by the Central Government, Employee State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) etc. are accounted for on an accrual basis. 
Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined contribution scheme.  
The company has no obligation, other than the contribution payable under the schemes. The company recognizes contribution payable to the provident fund scheme / ESIC as expenditure, when 
an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme / ESIC for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit 
payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the 
balance sheet date, then excess is recognized as an asset. 
3.16.2 
Defined Benefit schemes 
Gratuity 
The Company provides for gratuity covering eligible employees under which a lumpsum payment is paid to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, 
of an amount reckoned on the respective employee’s salary and his tenor of employment with the Company. The Company accounts for its liability for future gratuity benefits based on actuarial 
valuation determined at each Balance Sheet date by an Independent Actuary using Projected Unit Credit Method. The Company makes contributions to a Gratuity Fund administered by the Life 
Insurance Corporation of India.  
The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan are based 
on the market yields on Government Securities as at the Balance Sheet date.     
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases 
and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed 
at each reporting date. 
Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability), are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with 
a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassiﬁed to proﬁt and loss in subsequent periods. 
3.17 Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the enterprise determines the level of provision by discounting the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific 
to the liability. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. 
3.18  Taxes 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.

3.18.1 Current Tax 
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of taxable profit for a period. Taxable profit differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss because 
of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws.  
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of reporting date in India where the Company operates and generates 
taxable income. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
3.18.2 Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income tax is determined 
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is probable that future taxable amounts will arise to utilise those temporary 
differences and losses. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit and loss is recognised either in other comprehensive income or in equity. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on 
the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities are realised simultaneously. 
3.18.3 Goods and services tax /value added taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses 
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the goods and services tax/value added taxes paid, except: 
i.
When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the
asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable
ii. When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included
The net amount of tax recoverable from and / or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables respectively in the balance sheet. 
3.19 Contingent Liabilities and assets 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond 
the control of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also 
arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its 
existence in the ﬁnancial statements. 
F 505


# Page 688
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be conﬁrmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not 
wholly within the control of the entity. The company does not have any contingent assets in the ﬁnancial statements. 
3.20 Earnings Per Share 
The Company reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable 
to equity shareholders (after deducting preference dividend and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted 
for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have been issued at a later date. In 
computing the dilutive earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that either reduces the earnings per share or increases loss per share are included. 
3.21 Dividends on ordinary shares 
The Company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders of the Company when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion 
of the Company. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. 
Non-cash distributions are measured at the fair value of the assets to be distributed with fair value re-measurement recognised directly in equity. 
Upon distribution of non-cash assets, any difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the carrying amount of the assets distributed is recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss. 
3.22 Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement 
is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
Transition to Ind AS 116 
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) through Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2019 and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Second Amendment 
Rules, had notified Ind AS 116 Leases which replaces the existing lease standard, Ind AS 17 Leases, and other interpretations. Ind AS 116 sets out the principles for recognition, measurement, 
presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. It introduces single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for leases. 
The Company had adopted Ind AS 116, effective annual reporting period beginning April 1, 2019, using modified retrospective approach and accordingly previous period information has not 
been reinstated.  
Company as a lessee 
The Company’s lease asset class consist of building, equipment and vehicles. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a 
lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company has, at the date of transition, recognized a right-of 
use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short term lease) and low value assets. For 
these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.  
F 506


# Page 689
The right-of-use assets are recognized at cost, which comprises the present value of the lease liability as at the date of transition. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the balance lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease 
payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit on the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates. Interest accrued on lease liability and lease payments 
made, are subsequently adjusted to the initial recognition of lease liability. 
On application of Ind AS 116, the nature of expenses has changed from lease rent in previous periods to depreciation cost for the right-to-use asset, and finance cost for interest accrued on lease 
liability. For leases that were classified as finance lease applying Ind AS 17, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of transition to Ind AS 116 is the 
carrying amount of the lease asset and the lease liability on the transition date as measured applying Ind AS 17. 
Company as a lessor 
Leases where the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased items are operating leases. Rental Income arising from operating leases 
is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss.  
3.23 Cash flow statement 
Cash flows are reported using indirect method, whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash 
receipts or payments and items of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from regular revenue generating (operating activities), investing and 
financing activities of the Company are segregated. 
4 
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the 
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. 
In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognized 
in the ﬁnancial statements is included in the following notes: 
4.1 
Business Model Assessment 
Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The Company determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups 
of financial assets are managed together to achieve a business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the performance of the assets is 
evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Company 
monitors financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity to understand the reason for their disposal 
and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for which the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Company’s continuous assessment of whether the business model 
for which the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the 
classification of those assets. 
F 507


# Page 690
4.2 
Deﬁned employee beneﬁt assets and liabilities 
The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions 
that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the 
valuation and its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
4.3 
Fair value measurement: 
When the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using 
various valuation techniques. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair 
values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of ﬁnancial 
instruments. 
4.4 
Impairment of financial assets 
The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when 
determining impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by several factors, changes in which can result in different levels of allowances. 
It has been the Company’s policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience, regulatory advisories, market conditions and forecasts and revise when necessary.  
4.5 
Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method 
The Company’s EIR methodology, recognises interest income / expense using a rate of return that represents the best estimate of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of 
loans given / taken and recognises the effect of potentially different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments and penalty interest 
and charges). 
This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and life-cycle of the instruments, as well expected changes to India’s base rate and other fee 
income/expense that are integral parts of the instrument. 
4.6 
Other estimates: 
These include contingent liabilities, useful lives of tangible and intangible assets etc.

The Company has sold some loans and advances measured at amortised cost, as a source of finance. As per terms of the deal, risk and reward has been transferred to the customer. Hence, as per the derecognition criteria of IND AS
109, including transfer of substantially all risks and rewards relating to assets being transferred to the buyer being met, the assets have been derecognised. The table below summarises the carrying amount of the derecognised
financial assets:
The Company had used securitisation as a source of finance by way of securitising its gold loans to different entities. These entities were not related to the Company. Also, the Company neither held any equity nor other interest nor
control in them. 
As per the terms of the agreement, the Company was exposed to first loss ranging to 5%-7% of the amount securitised and therefore continued to be exposed to significant risk and rewards relating to the underlying loans. These
receivables were not derecognised and proceeds received were recorded as a financial liability under borrowings.
The table below outlines the carrying amounts and fair values of all financial assets transferred that were not derecognised in their entirety and associated liabilities.
Nature and Purpose

 - funding for the Company's
lending activities
 - Spread through sale of
assets to investors
 - Fees for servicing loan
 - Servicing fee
 - Credit Enhancement provided by the
Company
 - Excess interest spread

14.1. The Company operates its branch network predominantly through premises taken on lease at strategic locations identified by the management. Majority of the lease arrangements are long term in
nature and are non-cancellable from the point of view of the lessor, except for a few lease contracts. Other than such leasehold property, the Company has also undertaken lease arrangements for Safety
Device Equipments and Vehicles, whose original lease tenures too are not short-term in nature. Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted Ind AS 116 “Leases” and applied the standard to all lease
contracts existing on April 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method. Consequently, the Company recorded the lease liability at the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted at the
incremental borrowing rate as on the date of transition and has measured right of use asset at an amount equal to lease liability adjusted for any accrued lease payments previously recognised.
14.2. The expense relating to payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability is as follows:

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under
current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair values have been derived,
financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques.

42 Segment Reporting
The equity instruments which are actively traded on public stock exchanges with readily available active prices on a regular basis are classified as Level 1. Units held in mutual funds are measured based on their
published net asset value (NAV), taking into account redemption and/or other restrictions are generally Level 1. Equity instruments in non-listed entities are initially recognised at transaction price and re-measured as per
fair valuation report and valued on a case-by-case has been classified as Level 2.
For investment at fair value through profit and loss, valuation are done using quoted prices from active markets or on published Net Asset Values of the investment at the measurement date. 
Set out below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the financial statements. This table does not include the fair
values of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.
Particulars
Level
Carrying Value
Fair Value
For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts, which are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Such
instruments include: cash and balances, Trade receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents and trade payables without a specific maturity. Such amounts have been classified as Level 3 on the basis that no
adjustments have been made to the balances in the balance sheet.
The fair values of loans and receivables are estimated by discounted cash flow models that incorporate assumptions for credit risks, probability of default and loss given default estimates. Since comparable data is not
available, hence Credit risk is derived using, historical experience, management view and other information used in its collective impairment models.
Fair values of portfolios are calculated using a portfolio-based approach, grouping loans as far as possible into homogenous groups based on similar characteristics ie, type of loan. The Company then calculates and
extrapolates the fair value to the entire portfolio using Effective interest rate model that incorporate interest rate estimates considering all significant characteristics of the loans. The credit risk is applied as a top-side
adjustment based on the collective impairment model incorporating probability of defaults and loss given defaults.
The fair values of financial liability held-to-maturity are estimated using a effective interest rate  model based on contractual cash flows using actual yields. 
In accordance with Para 4 of IND AS 108, Operating Segments, segment information has been presented in the consolidated financial statements of Muthoot FinCorp Limited and therefore, no separate disclosure has

The Company addresses credit risk through following major processes:
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include
loans, investments, cash and cash equivalents and other receivables that derive directly from its operations. 
As a financial lending institution, Company is exposed to various risks that are related to lending business and operating environment. The principal objective in Company 's risk management processes is to measure and monitor the various risks that
Company is subject to and to follow policies and procedures to address such risks. 
The Company's Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors constituted in accordance with the RBI rules has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Risk Management Policy. The committee meets quarterly to
review the Risk Management practices and working of the Risk Management Department. The committee is chaired by an Independent Director. Risk Management department periodically places its report to the committee for review. The
committee’s suggestions for improving the Risk Management Practices are implemented by the Risk Management department.  
The Company has implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to assess, monitor and manage risk throughout the Group. The risk management process is continuously reviewed, improved and adapted in the changing risk scenario and the
agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the changing risk landscape. The process of continuous evaluation of risks includes taking stock of the risk landscape on an event-driven basis. The Company
has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically addressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis.
The major type of risk Company faces in business are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk.
Credit Risk arises from the risk of loss that may occur from the default of Company's customers under loan agreements. Customer defaults and inadequate collateral may lead to higher NPAs.
- Standardize the process of identifying new risks and designing appropriate controls for these risks
- Minimize losses due to defaults or untimely payments by borrowers
- Maintain an appropriate credit administration and loan review system 
- Establish metrics for portfolio appraisal and monitoring
- Design appropriate credit risk mitigation techniques
The Company’s impairment assessment and measurement approach is set out in this note. It should be read in conjunction with the Summary of significant accounting policies.
The Company considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.
As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Company also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such events occur, the Company carefully considers whether the event should result
in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate.
It is the Company’s policy to consider a financial instrument as ‘cured’ and therefore re-classified out of Stage 3 when none of the default criteria have been present for at least three consecutive months. The decision whether to classify an asset as
Stage 2 or Stage 1 once cured depends on the updated credit grade, at the time of the cure, and whether this indicates there has been a significant increase in credit risk compared to initial recognition. 
Company's internal credit rating grades and staging criteria for  loans are as follows:
F 547

|---|---|---|
| High grade | Not yet due | Stage I |
| Standard grade | 1-30 DPD | Stage I |

| Past due but not impaired | 60-89 DPD | Stage II |
| Individually impaired | 90 DPD or More | Stage III |

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company may not meet its financial obligations. Liquidity risk arises due to the unavailability of adequate funds at an appropriate cost or tenure. The objective of liquidity risk management, is to maintain
sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Company consistently generates sufficient cash flows from operating and financial activities to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. Our
resource mobilisation team sources funds from multiple sources, including from banks, financial institutions, capital & retail markets to maintain a healthy mix of sources. The resource mobilisation team is responsible for diversifying fund raising
sources, managing interest rate risks and maintaining a strong relationship with banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies, other domestic and foreign financial institutions and rating agencies to ensure the liquidity risk is well
addressed.
The outstanding balance as at the reporting date is considered as EAD by the company.
The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. To calculate the ECL for a Stage 1 loan, the Company assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the calculation of the 12mECL. For Stage
2 and Stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the instruments. The Company uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products, schemes, ticket size,
loan to value and geographies, the Company has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach considering fresh slippage using historical information. 
The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Company expects to receive. LGD Rates for Gold
Loans have been computed internally based on the discounted recoveries in NPA accounts that are closed/ written off/ repossessed and upgraded during the year. For other loans, LGD rates have been arrived at guided by the Foundational Internal
Ratings Based approach (FIRB) norms.
When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Company applies the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
Significant Increase in credit risk
The internal rating model evaluates the loans on an ongoing basis. The rating model also assesses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the previously assigned risk grade. One key factor that indicates significant increase in credit
risk is when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.
The table below shows the maturity pattern of the assets and liabilities:

Prepayment risk
Operational and business risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Company will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment earlier or later than expected.
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to operate effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial 
loss. The Company cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but it endeavours to manage these risks through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access, 
authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, such as the use of internal audit.
Market Risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market factor. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the interest rates and other 
market changes. The Company is exposed to two types of market risk as follows:
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is  subject to interest rate risk, principally because we lend to clients at fixed interest rates and for 
periods that may differ from our funding sources, while our borrowings are at both fixed and variable interest rates for different periods.  We assess and manage our interest rate risk by managing our assets and liabilities. Our Asset Liability 
Management Committee evaluates asset liability management, and ensures that all significant mismatches, if any, are being managed appropriately.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion of  borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the profit before taxes affected through the impact on floating rate 
borrowings is as follows:
Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decreases as the result of changes in level of equity indices and individual stocks.  The trading and non-trading equity price risk  exposure arises from equity securities classified at FVOCI”. A 
10% increase/(decrease) in the  equity price (traded and non-traded) would have the impact as follows:

The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact and volatility in the global and domestic economies resulting in decrease in economic activities. Increase in
infection rate and lockdowns / movement restrictions announced by the Central Government and various State Governments in lndia and the outbreak of the second wave of the pandemic
may further slowdown the economic activity. However, this has not resulted in a significant impact on the financial position of the Company as at the reporting date.
Pursuant to the relevant Reserve Bank of India circulars allowing lending institutions to offer moratorium to borrowers on payment of instalments falling due between March 1, 2020 and
August 31, 2020, the Company had granted moratorium to its borrowers based on its Board approved policy. For such accounts, where the moratorium was granted, the asset / stage-wise
classification remained stand still during the moratorium period. Pursuant to the judgement of the Honourable Supreme Court dated March 23, 2021, vacating the interim order not to declare
accounts as NPA and the RBI circular thereon, the Company has carried out the asset classification of borrowers as at March 31, 2021 as per the ECL model and the extant RBI instructions /
IRAC norms. Further, in accordance with the relevant circulars on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector – Restructuring of Advances, the Company has restructured a total
of 1,600 MSME accounts, amounting to INR 2,703.11 during the year ended March 31, 2021. The Company continues to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its liquidity and
ability to repay its obligations as and when they fall due and the management believes that the Company will be able to pay its obligations as and when these become due in the foreseeable
future. The Company would continue to focus on maintaining adequate capital and ensuring liquidity at all points in time.

Independent Auditor's Review Report on unaudited standalone financial results of the 
Company pursuant to Regulation 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
To 
The Board of Directors, 
Muthoot Fincorp Limited, 
Muthoot Centre, Punnen Road, 
Thiruvananthapuram - 695 001 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results of
M/s. Muthoot Fincorp Limited, TC No 27/3022, Muthoot Centre, Punnen Road,
Thiruvananthapuram - 695001 ("the Company") for the quarter ended June 30, 2023
("Statement"), being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 52
of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as
amended, read with relevant circulars issued by SEBI.
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by
the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and
measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial
Reporting" (IND AS 34), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as
amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally
accepted in India and in compliance with the Listing Regulations read with relevant circulars
issued by the SEBI. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our
review.
3. We conducted our Review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE)
2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This Standard requires that
we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is
free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel
and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provide less assurance than an
audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to
believe that the accompanying Statement of standalone, unaudited financial results prepared
in accordance with the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards and other accounting principles
generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms
