“Any person who: 
 
(a) makes or abets making of an application in a fictitious name to a company for acquiring, or subscribing for, its 
securities; or  
(b) makes or abets making of multiple applications to a company in different names or in different combinations of his 
name or surname for acquiring or subscribing for its securities; or 
(c) otherwise induces directly or indirectly a company to allot, or register any transfer of, securities to him, or to any 
other person in a fictitious name, shall be liable for action under Section 447 of the Companies Act, 2013” 
 
The liability prescribed under Section 447 of the Companies Act 2013 for fraud involving an amount of at least ₹10 lakh 
or 1.00% of the turnover of the Company, whichever is lower, includes imprisonment for a term which shall not be less 
than six months extending up to 10 years (provided that where the fraud involves public interest, such term shall not be 
less than three years) and fine of an amount not less than the amount involved in the fraud, extending up to three times 
of such amount. In case the fraud involves (i) an amount which is less than ₹10 lakh or 1.00% of the turnover of the 
Company, whichever is lower; and (ii) does not involve public interest, then such fraud is punishable with an 
imprisonment for a term extending up to five years or a fine of an amount extending up to ₹50 lakh or with both.  
 
Minimum Subscription 
 
In terms of the SEBI NCS Regulations, for an issuer undertaking a public issue of debt securities the minimum 
subscription for public issue of debt securities shall be 75% of the Base Issue Size. If our Company does not receive the

unblocked in the relevant ASBA Account(s) of the Applicants within eight Working Days from the Tranche II Issue 
Closing Date provided wherein, the Application Amount has been transferred to the Public Issue Account from the 
respective ASBA Accounts, such Application Amount shall be refunded from the Refund Account to the relevant ASBA 
Accounts(s) of the Applicants within eight Working Days from the Tranche II Issue Closing Date, failing which our 
Company will become liable to refund the Application Amount along with interest at the rate 15 (fifteen) percent per 
annum for the delayed period. 
 
Under Section 39(3) of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rule 11(2) of the Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of 
Securities) Rules, 2014 if the stated minimum subscription amount is not received within the specified period, the 
application money received is to be credited only to the bank account from which the subscription amount was remitted. 
To the extent possible, where the required information for making such refunds is available with our Company and/or 
Registrar, refunds will be made to the account prescribed. However, where our Company and/or Registrar does not have 
the necessary information for making such refunds, our Company and/or Registrar will follow the guidelines prescribed

OUTSTANDING LITIGATIONS AND DEFAULTS 
 
The Company is subjected to various legal proceedings from time to time, mostly arising in the ordinary course of its 
business. The legal proceedings are initiated by us and also by customers, past employees and other parties. These legal 
proceedings are primarily in the nature of (a) consumer complaints, (b) criminal complaints, and (c) civil suits. We believe 
that the number of proceedings in which we are involved is not unusual for a company of our size in the context of doing 
business in India. 
 
As on the date of this Tranche II Prospectus, except as disclosed below, there are no failures or defaults to meet statutory 
dues, institutional dues and dues towards instrument holders including holders of debentures, fixed deposits, and arrears

‘material' litigation:  
 
• 
all pending proceedings whether civil, arbitral, tax related litigations, or otherwise, of value exceeding more than 1% 
of our profit after tax as on March 31, 2023, i.e. more than ₹ 459.81 lakhs;  
 
• 
any other outstanding legal proceeding which is likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial position, 
profitability and cash flows of our Company which may affect the issue or the investor’s decision to invest/continue to 
invest in the debt securities. 
 
Save as disclosed below, there are no:  
 
1. litigation or legal action pending or taken by any Ministry or Department of the Government or a statutory authority 
against the Promoter of the Company during the last three years immediately preceding the year of the issue of this 
Tranche II Prospectus and any direction issued by such Ministry or Department or statutory authority upon conclusion 
of such litigation or legal action; 
2. litigation involving the Company, Promoter, Directors, subsidiaries, group companies or any other person, whose 
outcome could have material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company, which may affect the issue or 
the investor’s decision to invest/continue to invest in the debt securities; 
3. pending proceedings initiated against the Company for economic offences and default; and 
4. inquiries, inspections or investigations initiated or conducted under the Securities laws or Companies Act or any 
previous companies’ law, or reservations, qualifications or adverse remarks of the auditors of the Company in the last 
three years immediately preceding the year of issue of this Tranche II Prospectus against the Company. 
 
I. 
Litigations by and against the Company  
 
A. Litigations against the Company 
 
Criminal Proceedings

petitions in the matter and the court discharged them from the case, pursuant to the order dated May 2, 2005. Aggrieved 
by the above order, the Registrar of Companies, Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad, filed Criminal Revision Case 1305/2005

4. Legal Metrology Department had filed a complaint under the sections 190 and 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code 
before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Manjeri against the Company in 2019. Thereafter summons was issued 
to the Directors of the Company as well. The offence alleged is that lesser weight is mentioned in the pledge card as 
against the original weight and hence the allegation is that the customer will get cheated since the company is liable 
to return only the weight mentioned in the pledge card. However, in reality we mention both the gross and net weight 
of the ornaments and for the purpose of considering the weight of ornaments for pledge we rely upon the net weight 
which is after nominal deduction towards impurities and / stones. As the allegation is baseless. We have moved the 
Kerala High Court for quashing the proceedings and the matter has been stayed. The stay was extended by an interim 
order dated February 19, 2020. Stay has further been extended for a period of two months vide order dated February 
3, 2023. The matter is still pending. 
5. Abdul Kahder (“Complainant”) filed an FIR on April 28, 2016 under Sections 457 and 380 of the Indian Penal Code 
for recovery of gold ornaments that were allegedly stolen from his residence. The charge sheet on the matter was 
submitted by an investigating officer before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad on September 16, 2020 
against Mohammed Sameer for allegedly stealing the gold ornaments and mortgaging the same with MFL, which were 
subsequently sold through an auction. This matter is currently pending.

1. The Company issued a purchase order to R K Sales, a proprietary concern for the supply of doors, wardrobe, etc. for 
its 5 star hotel at Trivandrum. The said party supplied defective goods which it agreed to replace as per communications 
with MPG Hotels. However, the replaced goods were also defective and hence MPG Hotels procured the goods from 
other suppliers. Since the party supplied inferior quality goods, MPG Hotels did not pay for the said goods. The party 
filed a claim petition before UP State Micro & Small Enterprises Facilitation Council and preliminary objection was 
filed by MPG Hotels. However, pending conciliation, the Council passed an order directing to pay an amount of ₹ 
92,69,453 and an interest of ₹ 97,89,300.41, aggregating to a total of ₹ 1,90,58,753.41. Aggrieved by the said award, 
MPG Hotels has filed the Writ Petition. The order of the council is stayed by the Allahabad, High Court. The matter is 
pending for hearing and disposal. 
 
2. MPG Hotels built a software complex Muthoot Technopolis within the Cochin Special Economic Zone Authority 
(“CSEZA”), wherein software companies are the occupants. CSEZA is the distribution licensee for electricity supply. 
MPG Hotels was to provide electricity supply connections to sub-lessee/purchasers in Muthoot Technopolis and to 
collect charges. At all times the MPG Hotels performed as per the conditions laid down by CSEZA. This licensee 
CSEZA has no case that, MPG Hotels violated any of the conditions stipulated therein. As required by the licensee and 
as insisted, MPG Hotels shared electricity from High Tension (“HT”) electric connection with the subleases/purchasers 
of Muthoot Technopolis. The licensee never asked MPG Hotels to collect electricity duty @ 10% of energy charges 
from the subleases / purchasers and never required MPG Hotels to remit it to the licensee or to the state government. 
The licensee collected electricity duty at HT rates for the entire consumption of electricity metered at the point of 
supply. As a consumer of HT electricity under CSEZA distribution licensee, MPG Hotels did everything as required 
by the licensee only. Thereby, MPG Hotels is not at all liable to pay electricity duty applicable to Low Tension (“LT”) 
electricity supply which was never used by MPG Hotels and which was used by others as required by the licensee. A 
demand notice for ₹ 91,09,820.00 towards electricity duty arrears for the period from April, 2011 to March, 2016 dated 
March 2, 2017 has been issued to MPG Hotels. A writ petition has been filed by MPG Hotels praying to quash the 
demand notice and notice of disconnection. The court has stayed the operation of the notice of disconnection. Matter is 
currently pending. 
 
B. Tax Litigation  
 
1. The Tahsildar of Kanayannur Taluk has raised a demand of ₹56,07,000 towards building tax in respect of the 
Technopolis building at Kakkanad and the company has obtained stay from the Hon High Court of Kerala against 
enforcement of the demand.  An amount of ₹28,03,500 has been remitted by the Company based on the interim order 
of the High Court.  The management is confident of succeeding on the case in the High Court on the ground that 
property tax is not leviable on buildings in SEZ. 
2. The Assistant commissioner (Assessment), Commercial Taxes has raised a demand of ₹6,17,217 towards KGST 
assessment for the year 2005-06. The appeal filed by the company before the Deputy Commissioner (Appeals), 
Commercial Taxes against the said order is pending disposal and the management hopes to succeed on the appeal. 
3. The Assistant Commissioner- III (Assessment), Commercial Taxes has raised a demand of ₹1,13,905 towards KVAT 
assessment for the year 2013-14. An appeal has been filed by the company before The Deputy Commissioner (Appeals), 
Commercial Taxes against the said order, which is pending disposal. The company has paid an amount aggregating to 
₹22,781, being 20% of the demand raised under protest. The management is hopeful of succeeding on appeal and hence 
no provision has been made in respect of the above.

Mechanism for redressal of investor grievances 
 
Agreement dated August 7, 2023 between the Registrar to the Issue and our Company provides for settling of investor 
grievances in a timely manner and for retention of records with the Registrar to the Issue for a period of eight years.  
 
All grievances relating to this Tranche II Issue may be addressed to the Registrar to the Issue and Compliance Officer 
giving full details such as name, address of the applicant, number of NCDs applied for, amount paid on application and the 
details of Member of Syndicate or Trading Member of the Stock Exchange where the application was submitted.  
 
All grievances relating to the ASBA process may be addressed to the Registrar to the Issue with a copy to either (a) the 
relevant Designated Branch of the SCSB where the Application Form was submitted by the ASBA Applicant, or (b) the 
concerned Member of the Syndicate and the relevant Designated Branch of the SCSB in the event of an Application 
submitted by an ASBA Applicant at any of the Syndicate ASBA Application Locations, giving full details such as name, 
address of Applicant, Application Form number, option applied for, number of NCDs applied for, amount blocked on 
Application. 
 
Additionally, the Stock Exchange shall be responsible for addressing investor grievances arising from applications 
submitted online through the app based/ web interface platform of the Stock Exchange or through its Trading Members. 
Further, in accordance with the SEBI Master Circular, the Designated Intermediaries shall be responsible for addressing 
any investor grievances arising from the Applications uploaded by them in respect of quantity, price or any other data entry 
or other errors made by them. 
 
We estimate that the average time required by us or the Registrar to the Issue for the redressal of routine investor grievances 
will be three (3) business days from the date of receipt of the complaint. In case of non-routine complaints and complaints 
where external agencies are involved, we will seek to redress these complaints as expeditiously as possible.

Succession 
 
Where NCDs are held in joint names and one of the joint holders dies, the survivor(s) will be recognized as the Debenture 
Holder(s). It will be sufficient for our Company to delete the name of the deceased Debenture Holder after obtaining 
satisfactory evidence of his death. Provided, a third person may call on our Company to register his name as successor of 
the deceased Debenture Holder after obtaining evidence such as probate of a will for the purpose of proving his title to the 
debentures. In the event of demise of the sole or first holder of the Debentures, the Company will recognise the executors 
or administrator of the deceased Debenture Holders, or the holder of the succession certificate or other legal representative 
as having title to the Debentures only if such executor or administrator obtains and produces probate or letter of 
administration or is the holder of the succession certificate or other legal representation, as the case may be, from an 
appropriate court in India. The directors of the Company in their absolute discretion may, in any case, dispense with 
production of probate or letter of administration or succession certificate or other legal representation. In case of death of 
Debenture Holders who are holding NCDs in dematerialised form, third person is not required to approach the Company 
to register his name as successor of the deceased Debenture Holder. He shall approach the respective Depository Participant 
of the Debenture Holder for this purpose and submit necessary documents as required by the Depository Participant. 
 
Where a non-resident Indian becomes entitled to the NCDs by way of succession, the following steps have to be complied 
with: 
 
1. Documentary evidence to be submitted to the Legacy Cell of the RBI to the effect that the NCDs were acquired by the 
non-resident Indian as part of the legacy left by the deceased Debenture Holder. 
 
2. Proof that the non-resident Indian is an Indian national or is of Indian origin. 
 
3.  Such holding by a non-resident Indian will be on a non-repatriation basis. 
 
Joint-holders  
 
Where two or more persons are holders of any NCD(s), they shall be deemed to hold the same as joint holders with benefits 
of survivorship subject to other provisions contained in the Articles. 
 
Procedure for Re-materialization of NCDs 
 
Debenture Holders who wish to hold the NCDs in physical form may do so by submitting a request to their DP at any time 
after Allotment in accordance with the applicable procedure stipulated by the DP, in accordance with the Depositories Act 
and/or rules as notified by the Depositories from time to time. Holders of NCDs who propose to dematerialise their 
NCDs, would have to mandatorily submit details of their bank mandate along with a copy of any document 
evidencing that the bank account is in the name of the holder of such NCDs and their Permanent Account Number 
to the Company and the DP. No proposal for rematerialisation of NCDs would be considered if the aforementioned

No action would ordinarily be required on the part of the Debenture Holder at the time of redemption and the redemption 
proceeds would be paid to those Debenture Holders whose names stand in the register of Debenture Holders maintained 
by us on the Record Date fixed for the purpose of redemption. However, our Company may require that the NCD 
certificate(s), duly discharged by the sole holder/all the joint-holders (signed on the reverse of the NCD certificate(s)) be 
surrendered for redemption on maturity and should be sent by the Debenture Holder(s) by Registered Post with 
acknowledgment due or by hand delivery to our office or to such persons at such addresses as may be notified by us from 
time to time. Debenture Holder(s) may be requested to surrender the NCD certificate(s) in the manner as stated above, not 
more than three months and not less than one month prior to the redemption date so as to facilitate timely payment. 
 
We may at our discretion redeem the NCDs without the requirement of surrendering of the NCD certificates by the holder(s) 
thereof. In case we decide to do so, the holders of NCDs need not submit the NCD certificates to us and the redemption 
proceeds would be paid to those Debenture Holders whose names stand in the register of Debenture Holders maintained 
by us on the Record Date fixed for the purpose of redemption of NCDs. In such case, the NCD certificates would be deemed 
to have been cancelled. Also see “Terms of the Issue - Payment on Redemption” on page 115. 
 
NCDs held in electronic form:  
 
No action is required on the part of Debenture Holder(s) at the time of redemption of NCDs.  
 
Payment on Redemption  
 
The manner of payment of redemption is set out below: 
 
NCDs held in physical form on account of re-materialisation 
 
The payment on redemption of the NCDs will be made by way of cheque/pay order/ electronic modes. However, if our 
Company so requires, the aforementioned payment would only be made on the surrender of NCD certificate(s), duly 
discharged by the sole holder / all the joint-holders (signed on the reverse of the NCD certificate(s)). Dispatch of 
cheques/pay order, etc. in respect of such payment will be made on the redemption date or (if so requested by our Company 
in this regard) within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of the duly discharged NCD certificate. 
 
In case we decide to do so, the redemption proceeds in the manner stated above would be paid on the redemption date to 
those Debenture Holders whose names stand in the Register of Debenture Holders maintained by us/Registrar to the Issue 
on the Record Date fixed for the purpose of redemption. Hence the transferees, if any, should ensure lodgement of the 
transfer documents with us at least 15 (fifteen) days prior to the Record Date. In case the transfer documents are not lodged 
with us at least 15 (fifteen) days prior to the Record Date and we dispatch the redemption proceeds to the transferor, claims

Holders whose names appear on the list of beneficial owners given by the Depositories to us. These names would be as per 
the Depositories’ records on the Record Date fixed for the purpose of redemption. These NCDs will be simultaneously 
extinguished to the extent of the amount redeemed through appropriate debit corporate action upon redemption of the 
corresponding value of the NCDs. It may be noted that in the entire process mentioned above, no action is required on the 
part of Debenture Holders.  
 
Our liability to Debenture Holder(s) towards his/their rights including for payment or otherwise shall stand extinguished 
from the date of redemption in all events and when we dispatch the redemption amounts to the Debenture Holder(s).

have and shall be deemed always to have had the right to keep such NCDs in effect without extinguishment thereof, for 
the purpose of resale or reissue and in exercising such right, we shall have and be deemed always to have had the power to 
resell or reissue such NCDs either by reselling or reissuing the same NCDs or by issuing other NCDs in their place. The

TERMS OF PAYMENT 
 
The Application Forms will be uploaded onto the electronic system of the Stock Exchange and deposited with the relevant

Intermediaries, as the case may be (a list of such branches is available at https://www.sebi.gov.in).  
 
For Applications other than those under the UPI Mechanism, the relevant branch of the SCSB shall perform verification 
procedures and block an amount in the ASBA Account equal to the Application Amount specified in the Application. For 
Applications under the UPI Mechanism, i.e., upto ₹5 lakhs, the Stock Exchange shall undertake validation of the PAN and 
Demat account combination details of the Applicant with the Depository. The Depository shall validate the PAN and Demat 
account details and send response to the Stock Exchange which would be shared by the Stock Exchange with the relevant 
Designated Intermediary through its platform, for corrections, if any. The blocking of funds in such case (not exceeding 
₹5 lakhs) shall happen under the UPI Mechanism. 
 
The entire Application Amount for the NCDs is payable on Application only. The relevant SCSB shall block an amount 
equivalent to the entire Application Amount in the ASBA Account at the time of upload of the Application Form. In case 
of Allotment of lesser number of NCDs than the number applied, the Registrar to this Tranche II Issue shall instruct the 
SCSBs or the Sponsor Bank (as the case maybe) to unblock the excess amount in the ASBA Account. 
 
For Applications submitted directly to the SCSBs, the relevant SCSB shall block an amount in the ASBA Account equal 
to the Application Amount specified in the Application, before entering the Application into the electronic system of the 
Stock Exchange. SCSBs may provide the electronic mode of application either through an internet enabled application and

For Applications submitted under the UPI Mechanism, post the successful validation of the UPI Mandate Request by the 
Applicant, the information would be electronically received by the Applicants’ bank, where the funds, equivalent to 
Application Amount, would get blocked in the Applicant’s ASBA Account. 
 
Applicants should ensure that they have funds equal to the Application Amount in the ASBA Account before 
submitting the Application. An Application where the corresponding ASBA Account does not have sufficient funds 
equal to the Application Amount at the time of blocking the ASBA Account is liable to be rejected. 
 
A UPI Investor applying through the UPI Mechanism should ensure that, they check the relevant SMS generated 
for the UPI Mandate Request and all other steps required for successful blocking of funds in the UPI linked bank 
account, which includes accepting the UPI Mandate Request by 5:00 pm on the third Working Day from the day of 
bidding on the Stock Exchange (except on the last day of this Tranche II Issue Period, where the UPI Mandate 
Request not having been accepted by 5:00 pm of the next Working Day), have been completed. 
 
The Application Amount shall remain blocked in the ASBA Account until approval of the Basis of Allotment and

approved, and upon receipt of intimation from the Registrar, the controlling branch of the SCSB shall, on the Designated 
Date, transfer such blocked amount from the ASBA Account to the Public Issue Account. The balance amount remaining 
after the finalisation of the Basis of Allotment shall be unblocked by the SCSBs or the Sponsor Bank (in case of

respective SCSB or the Sponsor Bank, within six Working Days of this Tranche II Issue Closing Date. The Application

off. Rather, each Applicant whose Allotment size, prior to rounding off, had the highest decimal point would 
be given preference;

If an Applicant has applied for more than one Option of NCDs, and in case such Applicant is entitled to allocation

oversubscription, the option-wise allocation of NCDs to such Applicants shall be in proportion to the number of 
NCDs with respect to each option, applied for by such Applicant, subject to rounding off to the nearest integer, as 
appropriate in consultation with Lead Manager and Designated Stock Exchange.

Dear Mr. R. Nadanasabapathy, 
 
Re: Review of CRISIL Rating on the Non Convertible Debentures Aggregating Rs.1100 Crore^ of Muthoot Fincorp 
Limited 
 
All ratings assigned by CRISIL Ratings are kept under continuous surveillance and review. 
 
CRISIL Ratings has, after due consideration, reaffirmed its CRISIL AA-/Stable (pronounced as CRISIL double A minus rating 
with Stable outlook) rating on the captioned debt instrument. Securities with this rating are considered to have high degree of 
safety regarding timely servicing of financial obligations. Such securities carry very low credit risk. 
 
In the event of your company not making the issue within a period of 180 days from the above date, or in the event of any change 
in the size or structure of your proposed issue, a fresh letter of revalidation from CRISIL Ratings will be necessary. 
 
As per our Rating Agreement, CRISIL Ratings would disseminate the rating along with outlook through its publications and other 
media, and keep the rating along with outlook under surveillance for the life of the instrument. CRISIL Ratings reserves the right 
to withdraw, or revise the rating / outlook assigned to the captioned instrument at any time, on the basis of new information, or 
unavailability of information, or other circumstances which CRISIL Ratings believes may have an impact on the rating. Please 
visit www.crisilratings.com and search with the name of the rated entity to access the latest rating/s. 
 
As per SEBI circular (reference number: CIR/IMD/DF/17/2013; dated October 22, 2013) on centralized database for corporate 
bonds/debentures, you are required to provide international securities identification number (ISIN; along with the reference 
number and the date of the rating letter) of all bond/debenture issuances made against this rating letter to us. The circular also 
requires you to share this information with us within 2 days after the allotment of the ISIN. We request you to mail us all the 
necessary and relevant information at debtissue@crisil.com. This will enable CRISIL Ratings to verify and confirm to the 
depositories, including NSDL and CDSL, the ISIN details of debt rated by us, as required by SEBI. Feel free to contact us at 
debtissue@crisil.com for any clarification you may need. 
 
Should you require any clarification, please feel free to get in touch with us. 
 
With warm regards, 
 
 
Yours sincerely,

1 crore = 10 million
Refer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities
 
Detailed Rationale
CRISIL Ratings has assigned its ‘CRISIL AA-/Stable’ rating to Rs 100 crore of Subordinated debt, Rs 806.26 crore of Non-
convertible Debenture of Muthoot Fincorp Limited (MFL; flagship company of Muthoot Pappachan group [MPG]). The rating on
other debt instruments and bank facilities has been reaffirmed at ‘CRISIL AA-/CRISIL PPMLD AA-/CRISIL A/Stable/CRISIL A1+’.
 
CRISIL Ratings has withdrawn its rating on Non Convertible Debentures of Rs 326.3 crore (See Annexure 'Details of rating
withdrawn' for details) in line with its withdrawal policy. CRISIL Ratings has received independent confirmation that these
instruments are fully redeemed. 
 
The rating continues to reflect MFL’s healthy performance and strong market position in the core gold loan portfolio, as indicated
by steady growth in assets under management (AUM), sound asset quality.
 
Gold loan portfolio accounts for around 57% of the group’s overall AUM as on March 31, 2023 and stood at Rs 17,942 crore
(including co-lending of Rs 1153 crore). The non-gold loan portfolio accounted for around 43% of the total MPG portfolio as on
March 31, 2023. Out of this, the microfinance business accounted for Rs 9,180 crore AUM as on March 31, 2023, while the AUM
of vehicle and housing finance stood at Rs 2,102 crore and Rs 1,520 crore, respectively. The non-gold portfolio has faced
increased asset quality challenges especially in the aftermath of the second wave of pandemic. The management remains
cautious with continued focus on increasing collection efficiency. Also, they have made higher provisions buffers which are
sufficient to cover any further asset quality challenges.
 
The capital position was supported by the capital infusion at both standalone level and in the microfinance subsidiary.
Consequently, the networth at the consolidated level increased to Rs 4904 crore in fiscal 2023 as compared to Rs 3,595 crore in
fiscal 2021. Moreover, net gearing (adjusted for cash and real estate assets) at the standalone level improved to 4.2 times in
fiscal 2023 as compared to 4.8 times in fiscal 2022 and at consolidated level improved to 5.8 times in fiscal 2023 as compared to
6.0 times in fiscal 2022.

2/16
 
The ratings are further supported by promoters’ extensive experience in the loan-against-gold jewellery business, its established
market position in the gold business and diversified product profile of MPG. These strengths are partially offset by geographical
concentration in portfolio and potential challenges associated with non-gold loan segments.
Analytical Approach
For arriving at the ratings, CRISIL Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of MFL (engaged in businesses
of financing against gold jewellery, financing micro and small and medium enterprises [MSMEs]), Muthoot Microfin Limited (MML;
microfinance), Muthoot Capital Services Limited (MCSL; two-wheeler finance and MSME loans), and Muthoot Housing Finance
Company Limited (MHFCL; housing finance). This is because all the companies, collectively referred to as the MPG, have
significant financial, managerial and operational linkages. MML and MHFCL are subsidiaries of MFL while the promoters hold a
62.5% stake in MCSL. Furthermore, MFL has exposure to real estate assets which stood at Rs 451 crore (1.9% of total assets as
of March 31, 2023). CRISIL Ratings notionally allocates a part of networth towards such asset acquisition so as to simulate a
funding model for these assets, with low gearing (debt:equity) of 0.5 time.

Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description
Strengths:
Established market position in gold financing, supported by extensive experience of the promoters
MFL has established market position in the gold financing. The promoters have spent over seven decades in the business of
lending against gold jewellery. Over the years, the group has established a strong reputation and brand in South India and has
an appropriate assessment and underwriting methodology. MFL’s gold loan business grew at steady rate of 22% compound
annual growth rate (CAGR) over fiscals 2018 to 2020 and 21% in fiscal 2021 despite increase in competition from banks and
having a regulatory loan-to-value (LTV) disadvantage during last fiscal. However, in fiscal 2022, higher volatility in gold prices
between January and April 2021 followed by localised lockdown impose by states to curb the impact of the second wave of
covid-19 impacted the branch operations and disbursements during first half of current fiscal. This coupled with higher auctions in
Q3 of fiscal 2022, MFL’s gold loan AUM stood at Rs 18,125 crore as of March 2022 as compared to Rs 18,701 crore as of March
2021. In fiscal 2023, MFL’s gold loans AUM stood at Rs 17,942 crore. The total gold holding stood at around 48.09 tonnes on of
March 31, 2023 (51 tonnes as on March 31, 2020) owing to decline in the gold loan portfolio. During fiscal 2023, the company
disbursed 40,065 crore as compared to Rs 35,154 crore in fiscal 2022. The AUM per branch stood at Rs 5.2 crore as on March
31, 2023, as compared to Rs ~3.6 crore in fiscal 2019.
 
Diversified product profile of the MPG group
MPG has diversified its product profile over the past few years. Currently, the group operates in five major segments: loan
against gold jewellery, two-wheeler finance, microfinance, housing finance and small business loans. Overall managed AUM of
MPG is around Rs 31,587 crore as on March 31, 2023 (Rs 28,308 crore as on March 31, 2022). The proportion of gold loans has
remained high at 57% in March 2023 compared to 64% in March 2022. The microfinance portfolio is the second largest with
around 29% of overall portfolio of the group as on March 31, 2023. CRISIL Ratings believes that the gold loans will continue to
hold the largest share in the consolidated AUM over the medium term.
 
Improvement in capitalisation with the recent infusion
MFL’s networth, at standalone level, stood at Rs 4,050 crore (including CCCPS) as on March 31, 2023 as against Rs 3,602 crore
as on March 31, 2022. Capitalisation is further supported by low asset-side risks (security of gold jewellery, which is liquid and in
the lender’s possession). On a consolidated level, networth stood at Rs 4,904 crore (including CCCPS) as on March 31, 2023,
against Rs 4,271 crore as on March 31, 2022 which was bolstered by $50 million in MML by a PE investor Greater Pacific Capital
in fiscal 2022 and $10 million in September 2022. Moreover, net gearing (adjusted for cash and real estate assets) at the
standalone level improved to 4.2 times in fiscal 2023 as compared to 4.8 times in fiscal 2022 and at consolidated level improved
to 5.8 times in fiscal 2023 as compared to 6.0 times in fiscal 2022.
 
Furthermore, MFL’s exposure to real estate assets has reduced to Rs 451 crore in March 2023 (1.9% of total assets) as
compared to Rs 540 crore (2.2% of total assets) as on March 31, 2022 down from Rs 876 crore as on March 31, 2017 (6.5% of
total assets). The management is expected to maintain gearing at current level over the medium term. Any material increase in
gearing beyond current thresholds will be a key rating sensitivity factor.
 
Healthy asset quality in the gold loan segment to support overall group asset quality
The gross NPAs for MFL stood at 2.11% as on March 31, 2023 against 2.88% as on March 31, 2022. Further there is a negligible
impact of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) clarification released in November 2021 on the NPAs as gold loans are demand loans
where the interest and principal amount are due for payment at the end of tenor. However, CRISIL Ratings notes that due to
asset quality issues and the pandemic, the company, incrementally, has reduced its exposure to the SME segment and has
started focusing primarily on gold loan products. The proportion of SME loans has reduced further to around 4% of the overall
group’s AUM as on March 31, 2023, from 8% as on March 31, 2018. Additionally, company is doing regular auctions of gold
loans which would help in reducing GNPA below 1% in gold loans. In the gold loan segment, MFL has maintained healthy asset
quality over the years, backed by strong collection efficiency. Asset quality, as better measured by credit costs, has also been
under control within 0.5% during this period for gold loans. In fiscal 2023, credit cost stood at 0.3%. Post second wave of covid,
company has been doing regular auctions since June 2021. Furthermore, company is focusing on short tenure (6-month) gold
loan product compared to average 9-month product in the previous fiscal. This should help MFL de-risk the portfolio from any
sharp movements in gold prices in the near term.
 
Improving earnings profile for gold loan business
MFL's profitability, on standalone basis, has improved over the last 2-3 years on account of higher returns from the gold business
during the pandemic, steady reduction in overall opex cost over the years and overall low credit costs. RoMA improved
significantly to 1.7% in fiscal 2021 compared to just 1.2% and 1.0% in fiscal 2020 and 2018, respectively. In fiscal 2022, MFL
reported slight reduction in RoMA to 1.5% owing to slight decline in NIMs and rise in operating cost associated with core banking
migration and rise in employee benefit expense. In fiscal 2023, RoMA improved at 1.9%. If we adjust for non-interest bearing
assets, profitability improves to 2.4% in fiscal 2023. MFL has maintained its focus on regular interest collection which may reduce

3/16
loss on interest income, if any, on auction of pledged jewellery. Furthermore, with the current trend in gold prices, the company is
not expecting any issues with respect to interest losses.
 
On a consolidated level, RoMA improved to 2.0%  in fiscal 2023 as compared to 0.7% in fiscal 2022. MFL’s profitability is
expected to support the consolidated profitability. Additionally, with the improvement in the earning profile of subsidiaries and
MCSL, overall profitability is expected to improve further in fiscal 2024. As of March 2023, MML has total provisioning buffer of Rs
172 crore (1.9% of the total book). Given the higher provisioning buffer, company is well placed to cover any further asset quality
challenges. Additionally, the removal of interest rate cap as per new RBI directives is expected to bolster the profitability of the
company. Similarly, MCSL is carrying a huge provision buffer of Rs 393 crore (18.7% of the on book portfolio as of March 31,
2023), write backs are also expected in the current fiscal in addition to the improving profitability on account of expected growth.
Therefore, profitability of MPG is expected to improve steadily over the medium term. However, the group’s ability to manage
earnings primarily within non-gold segments will be monitored.
 
Weakness:
Geographical concentration in portfolio
High geographical concentration persists, with South India accounting for around 60% of the gold loan portfolio as on March 31,
2023 (as compared to 70% as on March 31, 2019). This was achieved by increase in per branch business from branches other
than southern branches, opening of new branches in North, East and South and closure or merger of non-viable branches in
South India. At the MPG level, around 80% of AUM is concentrated in South Indian states. While the level of concentration has
been declining, it is higher than that of its peers. Presently, the demand for gold loans has been high in the region. Therefore, the
proportion of AUM from the South region may not decline further in the current fiscal.
 
Potential challenges associated with non-gold loan segments
The non-gold segments accounted for 43% of the overall portfolio as on March 31, 2023. While MPG has managed to grow
these businesses and increase the segmental share over the last 2-3 years, potential challenges linked to seasoning of the loan
book and asset quality remain. In fiscal 2023, microfinance portfolio and housing finance portfolio has registered a double-digit
growth of 47% and 14% respectively and vehicle loan portfolio grew by only 2.2%.
 
However, asset quality in both microfinance and vehicle finance segments has witnessed deterioration. The 90+ dpd level for
MML stood at 5.1% as on March 31, 2023 (6.8% as on March 31, 2022). The GNPA in case of MCSL stood at 20.55% as on
March 31, 2023 as against 25.9% as on March 31, 2022. The 90+ dpd for MHFCL stood at 0.8% as on March 31, 2023 (3.9% as
on March 31, 2022). 
 
The microfinance and vehicle finance businesses are more prone to risks arising due to the pandemic. Nevertheless, post
September 2020, CRISIL Ratings has observed substantial improvement in the collection efficiency within the vehicle finance
segment. The microfinance segment has also witnessed improvement in its collections consistently during the last quarter of
fiscal 2021. However, due to the second wave of Covid 19, collection efficiency dropped in the month of April 2021 and further in
the month of May 2021. However, it has picked up from June 2021 onwards. CRISIL Ratings believes that the consolidated credit
profile will be able to absorb asset quality risks in the microfinance, vehicle or housing finance businesses in the near
term. Furthermore, the non-gold segments are recovering post the pandemic. Nevertheless, CRISIL Ratings will continue to
closely monitor the delinquency trend and collection efficiencies in the non-gold loan segments in the near term. Additionally,
sufficiency of capital buffers to withstand asset-side shocks remains a key rating sensitivity factor.
Liquidity: Strong
As per Asset Liability Management (ALM) statement of March 31, 2023, MFL, on standalone basis, has cumulative positive gaps
in the upto 1 year bucket. As on June 30, 2023, MFL had liquidity of Rs 1,902 crore (Rs 1,179 crore of cash and equivalent and
Rs 723 crore of CC/WCDL). Against this, they have total debt repayments (including operating expense) of Rs 1,535 crore in the
next three months. The total debt repayments exclude CC / WCDL limits which are typically rolled over. CRISIL Ratings notes
that MFL has been able to rollover the CC/WCDL limits in the past and also during the previous three months and expects to be
able to rollover the balance limits falling due in coming months.
 
In terms of collections, the company had average collections of around Rs 3,997 crore on monthly basis during the Q4 2023. In
terms of additional funding, In fiscal 2023, MFL has raised Rs 3155 crore in the form of terms and CP. While a larger proportion
of borrowing has been sourced as funding lines from banks and financial institutions such as term loans (30.1%) and CC/WCDL
(40.1%), the company’s resource profile remained diversified across avenues, such as NCDs (19.0%) and subordinated debt
(10.9%) as on March 31, 2023.
Outlook: Stable
CRISIL Ratings believes MFL’s business profile will continue to be supported by its established market position in the gold loan
segment.

designed 
our 
audit 
procedures 
in 
accordance with Lhe guidelines laid down 
in the Standard on Auditing (SA 530) and 
tested Lhe controls in the Information 
Technology Systems on a sample basis 
which has an impact on U1e financial 
accounting and reporting records. We have 
also tested on a sample basis the controls

authorization 
for

on our sample review and audit report 
issued by other auditors, no material 
weakness was identified in the IT related 
systems and controls of the Group. 
At the branch level, entries related to daily 
operations are passed. We have addressed 
this as a key audit matter since any control 
lapses in the branch level accounting may 
resuJL in the financial accounting a.ml 
reporting records of the entity being 
misstated. We have physically visited the 
Holding Company's branches on a sample 
basis to identify and assess the effectiveness 
of U1e controls operating at Lhe branch level. 
We have also tested on a sample basis the 
independent financial records maintained 
at the branch level and how the same is 
considered 
and 
incorporated 
in

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included 111 lhe Group and of it:, 
associates and jointly controlled entities are responsible for overseeing the financial 
reporting process of the Group and of its associates and jointly controlled entities. 
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS FinanciaJ Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated l.nd AS 
Financial statements as a whole are free from malerial misstalement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a h:igh level of assurance, but is not a guarantee lhat an audit conducted in accordance with 
SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or en-or and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they couJd 
reasonably be expected to innuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these Consolidated ln<l AS financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professionaJ judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism Lhroughout Lhe auilit. We also: 
•
lJentify anJ assess the risks of material misstatement of the Conso(jdated Ind AS
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit
procedtues responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opitlion. The risk of not detecting a materiaJ
nusstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional onfr,sions, misrepre!'lentations, or,
the override of in Lerna! control.
•
Obtain an underslc1nding of internal financial controls relevant to the auJit in order
to design audit procedmes that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section
143(3)(1) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether
the Group has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating
l;'f(ectiveness of such controls.
•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and Lhe reasonableness ol
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management
•
Conclude on Lhe appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions U,at may cast si
the Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities to co
concern. lf we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are

ANNEXURE "A" TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
Referred to in Paragraph 1(£) tinder 'Report on other Legal and Regulatory
Requirements' of the Independent Auditors' Report of even date to the members of 
Muthoot Fincorp Limited on the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements as of and 
for the year ended 31st March, 2023. 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i)
of Sub section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act"): 
In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidateu lnu AS Financial Statements of the 
Company as of and for the year endeJ March 31, 2023, we have audited the internal 
financial controls over financial reporting of Muthoot Fincorp Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as "the Holding Company") and its subsidiary companies, which includes 
internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company and its subsidiary 
companies, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financiaJ controls 
based on the internal control over financiaJ reporting criteria established by the 
respective Companies considering the essential components of internal conb·ol stated in
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the lnstitute of Chartered Accountants of India. TI1ese responsibilities include 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate inlernal financial controls that 
were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective com.pany's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, tJ1e accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditors' Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an oplillon on the internal financial controls over 
financial reporting of the Holding Company and its subsidiary compimies, based on our
audit We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of 
faternal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting ( the "Guidance Note") and the 
Standards on AudH:ing, both issued by the ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under 
section 143(10) of the Companies Act 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial conb·ols. Those Standards and the Guidance Note

assurance abuut whether adequate internal financial conl1·ols over financial reporting 
was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material 
respects. 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy 
of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over fu1ancial reporting included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial repmt:ing, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtaineJ and the audit evidence obtai11ed 
by the other auditors of the subsidiary companies are sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Group's internal financial controls system 
over financial reporting. 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 
A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of fina11cial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over f
inancinl 
reporting h1cludes those policies and procedures that; (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately anJ fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recon.led as necessary to pem1_it preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and direclors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements. 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal finru1cial controls over financial reporting, 
including the possibility of col1usion or improper manageU1ent override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial con 
F 13


# Page 196
reportlng may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Opinion 
ln our opinion, to the be.<,t of our information aml acconling to the explanations given to
us and based on the consideration of the reports of the other auditors referred to in the 
Other Matters paragraph below, the Holding Company and its subsicliary companies, 
have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over 
financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were 
operating effectively as at March 31,2023 based on the criteria for internal financial 
control over financial reporting established by the respective companies considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over financial Reporting issued by the lnstitute of 
Chartered Accotmtants of Cndia. 
Other Matters 
Our aforesaid report under Section l43(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating 
effectiveness of the internal finai,c.ial controls over financial reporting in so far as it 
relates to the subsidiary companies are based solely on the corresponding reports of the 
auditors of such company. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above m tt r.
