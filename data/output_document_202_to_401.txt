Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Management is satisfied that the Group shall be 
able to continue its business for the foreseeable future and no material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt 
on the going concern assumption. 
2.2 Presentation of financial Statements 
The Group presents its Balance Sheet in order of liquidity.  The Group prepares and presents its Balance Sheet, the 
Statement of Profit and Loss and the Statement of Changes in Equity in the format prescribed by Division III of Schedule 
III to the Act. The Statement of Cash Flows has been prepared and presented as per the requirements of Ind AS 7 
‘Statement of Cash Flows’. 
The Group generally reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis in the Balance Sheet. They are offset 
and reported net only when Ind AS specifically permits the same or it has an unconditional legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event. Similarly, the Group offsets incomes and 
expenses and reports the same on a net basis when permitted by Ind AS specifically unless they are material in nature. 
2.3 Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Company and all its subsidiaries, 
being the entities that it controls from the date control is gained. Control is evidenced where the investor is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the investee. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, 
which significantly affect the entity’s returns. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting 
year as the Parent Company. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align 
the accounting policies in line with accounting policies of the Parent Company. 
These consolidated financial statements are prepared on the following basis in accordance with Ind AS 110 on 
“Consolidated Financial Statements” specified under Section 133 of the Act. Following subsidiary companies have been 
considered in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 
i)
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through
its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the date on which controls commences until the date on which control ceases.
ii)
Non-controlling interest (“NCI”)
NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.
Changes in the Group’s equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as
equity transactions.
iii)
Loss of control
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and
any related NCI and other component of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at
fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit and
loss.

iv) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
The financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary used in the consolidation procedure are
drawn up to the same reporting date i.e. March 31, 2023. The financial statements of the Holding Company and
its subsidiary are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Intra-group balances and transactions, and unrealized income and expenses
arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as
unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. The Group follows uniform
accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. For additional information as
required by Paragraph 2 of the General Instructions for preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements to
Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, refer Note 50.
2.4 
Basis of measurement 
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for following assets and liabilities which 
have been measured at fair value: 
i)
Investments in equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
ii)
Financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
iii)
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
iv)
Investments which are held for trading
v)
Assets held for sale are measured at fair value less cost to sell or carrying value whichever is lower
vi)
Defined benefit plans.
vii)
Derivative Financial Instruments
2.5 
Functional and presentation currency 
The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR) which is also functional currency of the Group and the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. All values are rounded to the nearest lakhs, 
except when otherwise indicated.  
3.
Significant accounting policies
3.1 
Recognition of interest income
Interest income is recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial 
assets other than credit-impaired assets and financial assets classified as measured at FVTPL. 
 The EIR in case of a financial asset is computed  
a.
As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to
the gross carrying amount of a financial asset.
b.
By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.
c.
Including all fees received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate,
transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.
Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets. 
3.2 .  Recognition of revenue from sale of goods and services 
Revenue (other than for financial instruments) is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Ind 
AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers outlines a single comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising 
from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance found within Ind ASs. 
The Group recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in Ind 115: 
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that 
creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met. 
F 21


# Page 204
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a 
customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. 
Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects 
to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties. 
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than 
one performance obligation, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that 
depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance 
obligation. 
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation 
Revenue from contract with customer for rendering services is recognised at a point in time when performance obligation 
is satisfied. 
3.2.1 
Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and the amount of the dividend can be measured 
reliably. 
3.2.2 
Income from assignment transactions 
Income from assignment transactions i.e., present value of excess interest spread is recognised when the related loan 
assets are de-recognised. Interest income is also recognised on carrying value of assets over the remaining period of such 
assets. 
3.2.3 
Rental Income 
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included 
in rental income in the statement of profit and loss, unless the increase is in line with expected general inflation, in which 
case lease income is recognised based on contractual terms. 
3.2.4 
Fees and commission income 
Fees and commission income such as service charges, commission from fee-based business lines, service income etc. are 
recognised on point in time basis. 
3.2.5 
Miscellaneous Income 
All other income is recognized on an accrual basis, when there is no uncertainty in the ultimate realization/collection. 
3.3 
Financial instruments  
A.
Financial Asset
3.3.1 
Initial recognition 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Loans are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account. Investments are recognised on the date when 
the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions. The Group recognises debt securities, deposits and borrowings 
when funds reach the Group and post allotment, where applicable. 
3.3.2 Initial and subsequent measurement of financial instruments 
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: 
1.
Debt instruments at amortised cost
2.
Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).
3.
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
4.
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI.
F 22


# Page 205
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
The classification depends on the contractual terms of the financial assets’ cash flows and the Group’s business model 
for managing financial assets which are explained below: 
Business model assessment 
The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to 
achieve its business objective. 
The Group's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated 
portfolios and is based on observable factors such as: 
► How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated
and reported to the entity's key management personnel
► The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model)
and the way those risks are managed
► How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of
the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected)
► The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Group’s assessment.
► The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ 
scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group's
original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that
business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial
assets going forward.
The SPPI test 
As a second step of its classification process, the Group assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify 
whether they meet the SPPI test. 
‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may 
change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the 
premium/discount). 
In making this assessment, the Group considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending 
arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks 
and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure 
to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through the 
profit and loss account or is required to measure liabilities at fair value through profit or loss such as derivative liabilities. 
3.3.3 Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect
contractual cash flows and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement at fair value plus directly attributable costs, these financial assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by considering any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in 
interest income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in statement of profit and loss. 
3.3.4 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both the following conditions are 
met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect
contractual cash flows and selling the assets and
F 23

Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding
Debt instruments included within the FVOCI category are measured at each reporting date at fair value with such changes 
being recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI). The interest income on these assets is recognised in profit or 
loss. Impairment losses or reversals, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit and 
loss. Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified 
from equity to the income statement.  
3.3.5 Financial Instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified 
as at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments that meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria but are designated 
as at FVTPL are measured at FVTPL. 
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVOCI criteria may be designated 
as at FVTPL upon initial recognition, if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition 
inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different 
bases. 
Group’s investment is classified as FVTPL, if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or 
repurchasing in the near term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for 
which there is evidence of short-term profit taking. 
Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value, with transaction costs 
recognised in the income statement as incurred. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value and any gains or losses are 
recognised in the income statement as they arise.  
3.3.6 Equity instruments 
The Group subsequently measures investment in equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, unless the Group’s 
management has elected to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI, when 
such instruments meet the definition of definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are 
not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Gains and losses on these equity instruments classified at FVOCI are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognised in profit or loss as dividend income when the right of the payment has been established, except when the 
Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are 
recorded in OCI.  
B. Financial Liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement 
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or the issue of financial liability, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are adjusted to fair value at initial 
recognition. 
Subsequent measurement  
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
3.4 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
3.4.1 
Financial Asset 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Group also derecognises 
the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.  
The Group has transferred the financial asset if, and only if, either: 
a)
The Group has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset
or
F 24


# Page 207
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
b)
It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full
without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass–through’ arrangement
Pass-through arrangements are transactions whereby the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows 
of a financial asset (the 'original asset'), but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more 
entities (the 'eventual recipients'), when all of the following three conditions are met: 
► The Group has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it has collected equivalent amounts
from the original asset, excluding short-term advances with the right to full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued
interest at market rates
► The Group cannot sell or pledge the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients
► The Group has to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay. In
addition, the Group is not entitled to reinvest such cash flows, except for investments in cash or cash equivalents
including interest earned, during the period between the collection date and the date of required remittance to the
eventual recipients.
A transfer only qualifies for derecognition if either: 
► The Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset
or
► The Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset
The Group considers control to be transferred if and only if, the transferee has the practical ability to sell the asset in 
its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without imposing additional 
restrictions on the transfer. 
When the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and has retained control of 
the asset, the asset continues to be recognised only to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement, in which case, 
the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a 
basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained. 
3.4.2 Financial Liability 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as de recognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability 
and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. 
3.5 Offsetting 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities 
are offset, and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and 
intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously in all the following 
circumstances: 
a.
The normal course of business
b.
The event of default
c.
The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group and/or its counter parties.
3.6 Impairment of financial assets 
3.6.1 
Overview of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) principles 
The Group has created provisions on all financial assets except for financial assets classified as FVTPL, based on the 
expected credit loss method. The Group also ensures maintaining the minimum provision requirement as per RBI and 
NHB regulations. 
F 25


# Page 208
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
The ECL provision is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit 
loss), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based 
on the 12 months’ expected credit loss. The 12-month ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs that 
result from default events on financial assets that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. 
The Group performs an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk 
has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the 
remaining life of the financial instrument. 
Based on the above process, the Group categorises its loans into three stages as described below: 
For non-impaired financial instruments 

Stage 1 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have not experienced a significant increase
in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. A 12-month ECL provision is made for stage 1 financial
instruments. In assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Group compares the risk of a default
occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date, with the risk of a default occurring on the financial
instrument as at the date of initial recognition.

Stage 2 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have experienced a SICR since initial
recognition. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for stage 2 financial instruments. In subsequent reporting
periods, if the credit risk of the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a SICR since initial
recognition, then entities recognize 12 months of ECL.
For impaired financial instruments: 
Financial instruments are classified as stage 3 when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more 
loss events that have occurred after initial recognition with a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows of a loan 
or a portfolio of loans. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for impaired financial instruments. 
3.6.2 
The calculation of ECLs 
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows: 
Probability of Default (PD) - The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time 
horizon. 
The Group uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products and schemes, 
the Group has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach 
considering fresh slippage using historical information.  
Exposure at Default (EAD) - The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering 
expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether 
scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed 
payments.  
Loss Given Default (LGD) – The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs 
at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect 
to receive.  
Forward looking information 
While estimating the expected credit losses, the Group reviews macro-economic developments occurring in the economy 
and market it operates in. On a periodic basis, the Group analyses if there is any relationship between key economic 
trends like GDP, unemployment rates, benchmark rates set by the Reserve Bank of India, inﬂation etc. with the estimate 
of PD, LGD determined by the Group based on its internal data. While the internal estimates of PD, LGD rates by the 
Group may not be always reﬂective of such relationships, temporary overlays, if any, are embedded in the methodology 
to reﬂect such macro-economic trends reasonably. 
Write-offs 
Loans are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case 
when it is determined that the customer does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufﬁcient cash 
F 26


# Page 209
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
ﬂows to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are credited to the 
statement of proﬁt and loss. 
Collateral 
To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Group seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in 
various forms, such as gold, cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, stock, current asset etc. However, the fair value 
of collateral affects the calculation of ECLs. The fair value of the same is based on data provided by third party or 
management judgements. 
Impairment of Trade receivables 
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The Group 
uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix 
is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables. 
3.7 Determination of fair value 
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, investments at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
i.
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
ii.
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability, if market participants act in their economic best interest. 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits 
by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use. 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which enough data are available 
to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
The financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as summarised below: 
Level 1 financial instruments − Those where the inputs used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group has access to at the measurement date. The Group considers 
markets as active only if there are sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical 
assets or liabilities and when there are binding and exercisable price quotes available on the balance sheet date. 
Level 2 financial instruments − Those where the inputs that are used for valuation and are significant, are derived from 
directly or indirectly observable market data available over the entire period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include 
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets 
and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit 
spreads. In addition, adjustments may be required for the condition or location of the asset or the extent to which it relates 
to items that are comparable to the valued instrument. However, if such adjustments are based on unobservable inputs 
which are significant to the entire measurement, the Group will classify the instruments as Level 3. 
Level 3 financial instruments − Those that include one or more unobservable input that is signiﬁcant to the measurement 
as whole. 
3.8 Foreign Currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the spot rate of ex-change ruling at 
the date of the transaction. However, for practical reasons, the Group uses an average rate if the average approximates 
the actual rate at the date of the transaction. 
F 27


# Page 210
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot 
rate of exchange at the reporting date. All differences arising on non–trading activities are taken to other income/expense 
in the statement of profit and loss.  
Non–monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange 
rates as at the date of recognition. 
3.9 Finance cost 
Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying 
amount of financial liabilities other than financial liabilities classified as FVTPL. 
Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognized as part of the carrying value of the financial liability 
and amortized over the expected life using the effective interest method. These include fees and commissions payable 
to advisers and other expenses such as external legal costs, provided these are incremental costs that are directly related 
to the issue of a financial liability. 
3.10 Other income and expenses  
All Other income and expense are recognized in the period they occur. 
3.11  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand, short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less and forex balances, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short- term deposits, as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts, if any as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management. 
3.12   Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, 
(if any). The total cost of assets comprises its purchase price, freight, duties, taxes and any other incidental expenses 
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by the management.  
Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, 
and treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible asset are added to its gross value only if it increases the future 
benefits of the existing asset, beyond its previously assessed standards of performance and cost can be measured reliably. 
Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed off as and when incurred. 
3.13 Depreciation 
Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost comprises the purchase price and any 
attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.  
Depreciation is charged based on a review by the management during the year and at the rates derived based on the useful 
lives of the assets as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 or estimated useful lives estimated by the 
respective management based on technical evaluation. The holding company and one of its subsidiaries, Muthoot 
Microfin Limited follow the Straight Line Method for providing depreciation whereas the two other subsidiaries follow 
Written Down Value Method.  
Leasehold improvements and assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of lease term or their useful 
life. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each 
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
Property plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in other income / expense in the statement of profit and loss in the year 
the asset is derecognised. The date of disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the date the recipient obtains

control of that item in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in 
Ind AS 115. 
3.14   Capital work-in-progress 
Capital work-in-progress are carried at cost, comprising direct cost and related incidental expenses. Assets which are not 
ready for intended use are also shown under capital work-in-progress. 
3.15    Intangible assets 
The Group’s intangible assets consist of computer software. 
An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the expected future 
economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the Group. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises 
its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use and net of any 
trade discounts and rebates. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised by the Group over a period of 3 years, except in case of Muthoot Pappachan Technologies 
Limited where the computer software is amortised over a period of 10 years or over the estimated useful lives. 
Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. 
3.16   Investment Property 
Properties, held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation are classified as investment property and measured and reported 
at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the assets carrying amount only when it is 
probable that the future economic benefit associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. 
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from 
use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of property 
is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the same period. The fair value of investment property is disclosed in 
the notes accompanying these financial statements. Fair value has been determined by an independent valuer who holds 
a recognised and relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the 
investment property being valued. 
3.17 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Groups assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal 
and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset 
or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining 
fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are considered. If no such transactions can be identified, an 
appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for 
publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the 
assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal 
is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
F 29


# Page 212
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which 
case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. 
3.18 
Post-employment benefits 
3.18.1 Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to the Employees Provident Fund Scheme maintained by the Central Government, Employee State 
Insurance Corporation (ESIC) etc. are accounted for on an accrual basis. Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund 
is a defined contribution scheme.  
The Group has no obligation, other than the contribution payable under the schemes. The Group recognizes contribution 
payable to the provident fund scheme / ESIC as expenditure, when an employee renders the related service. If the 
contribution payable to the scheme / ESIC for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution 
already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. 
If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then 
excess is recognized as an asset. 
3.18.2 
Defined Benefit schemes 
Gratuity 
The Group provides for gratuity covering eligible employees under which a lump sum payment is paid to vested 
employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount reckoned on the respective 
employee’s salary and his tenor of employment with the Group. The Group accounts for its liability for future gratuity 
benefits based on actuarial valuation determined at each Balance Sheet date by an Independent Actuary using Projected 
Unit Credit Method. The Group makes contributions to a Gratuity Fund administered by the Life Insurance Corporation 
of India.  
The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining 
the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan are based on the market yields on Government Securities 
as at the Balance Sheet date.     
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities 
involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. 
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net deﬁned 
beneﬁt liability), are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to other equity 
through OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassiﬁed to statement of proﬁt and loss in 
subsequent periods. 
3.19 
Share Based Payments 
The Group has formulated Employees Stock Option Schemes and Stock Appreciation Right Schemes (SAR). The fair 
value of options granted under Employee Stock Option Plan is recognised as an employee benefits expense with a 
corresponding increase in non-financial liability and the fair value of SAR granted is recognized as an employee benefit 
expense having a corresponding increase in financial liability. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the options. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which 
all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the group revises its estimates of the 
number of options that are expected to vest. 
3.20 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
F 30


# Page 213
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the enterprise determines the level of provision by discounting 
the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific to the liability. The expense relating to any 
provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. 
3.21 
Assets held for sale 
Assets possessed against the settlement of loans are carried in the balance sheet at a value of outstanding principal loan 
amount or fair value of asset whichever is lower. In case the fair value of the asset acquired is lower than the outstanding 
principal loan amount; then the shortfall is to be provided for in the books of account in such financial year. 
These assets are classified as ‘Assets held for sale’ under ‘Non-financial assets’ till the asset acquired is finally disposed. 
The outstanding overdue interest and other charges will be accounted on realization basis.  
Further, if on disposal of the assets so acquired, the sale proceed is higher than the receivable amount (including 
outstanding loan, outstanding overdue interest, other charges and interest), then the excess will be refunded to the 
borrowers. 
3.22 
Taxes 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
3.22.1 Current Tax 
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of taxable profit for a period. Taxable profit differs from 
‘profit before tax’ as reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws.  
Interest income / expenses and penalties, if any, related to income tax are included in current tax expense. The tax rates 
and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of reporting date 
in India where the Group operates and generates taxable income. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either 
in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
3.22.2 Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is probable 
that future taxable amounts will arise to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax assets are reviewed 
at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities are realised 
simultaneously. 
3.22.3 Goods and services tax /value added taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses 
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the goods and services tax/value added taxes paid, except: 
i.
When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in
which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense
item, as applicable
ii.
When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included
The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the balance sheet.

3.23 
Contingent Liabilities and assets 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present 
obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized 
because it cannot be measured reliably. The Group does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in 
the ﬁnancial statements. 
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be conﬁrmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity. The 
Group does not have any contingent assets in the ﬁnancial statements. 
3.24 
Earnings Per Share 
The Group reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic EPS 
is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting preference 
dividend and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity 
shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have been 
issued at a later date. In computing the dilutive earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that 
either reduces the earnings per share or increases loss per share are included. 
3.25 
Dividends on ordinary shares 
The Group recognises a liability to make distributions to equity holders of the Group when the distribution is authorised, 
and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is 
authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. 
3.26 
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement 
and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or 
assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
Group as a lessee 
The Groups lease asset class consists of building, equipment and vehicles. The Group assesses whether a contract contains 
a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group has, at the date of transition, recognized 
a right-of use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less (short term lease) and low value assets. For these short-term and low value leases, 
the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  
The right-of-use assets are recognized at cost, which comprises the present value of the lease liability as at the date of 
transition. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the balance lease term and useful 
life of the underlying asset. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future 
lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit on the lease or, if not readily 
determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates. Interest accrued on lease liability and lease payments made, are 
subsequently adjusted to the initial recognition of lease liability. 
Group as a lessor 
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased 
items are operating leases. Rental Income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the 
lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss. 
3.27 
Cash flow statement 
Cash flows are reported using indirect method, whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions 
of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments and items of income or 
F 32


# Page 215
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from regular revenue generating (operating 
activities), investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. 
3.28 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure 
to foreign exchange rate risk. Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date when a derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each Balance Sheet date and carried as assets when 
their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. The resulting gain/loss is recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and is effective as a hedging instrument, in 
which event the timing of the recognition in the Statement of Profit and Loss depends on the nature of the hedge 
relationship. The Group has designated the derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges of recognized liabilities 
and unrecognized firm commitments. 
3.29 
Hedge Accounting 
In order to manage particular risks, the Group applies hedge accounting for transactions that meet specific criteria. At the 
inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship and the risk 
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective if the 
hedging instrument is offsetting changes in fair value or cashflows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The 
assessment of hedge effectiveness is carried out at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine that the hedging 
relationship has been effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. 
3.30 
Cash Flow Hedges 
A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability (such as all or some future interest payments on variable rate debt) or a highly probable 
forecast transaction and could affect profit and loss. For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion 
of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument is initially recognized directly in Other Comprehensive Income 
(OCI) within equity (cash flow hedging reserve). The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is 
recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. When the hedged cash flow affects the Statement of Profit 
and Loss, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in the corresponding income or 
expense line of the Statement of Profit and Loss. When a hedging instrument is expired, sold, terminated, exercised, or 
when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss that has been recognized in 
OCI at that time remains in OCI and is recognized when the hedged forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss 
that was reported in OCI is immediately transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
4. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the 
accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimates are revised, and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the 
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could 
result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. 
In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognized in the ﬁnancial statements is included in the 
following notes: 
4.1 
Business Model Assessment 
Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The 
Group determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to 
achieve a business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the 
performance of the assets is evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets 
and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Group monitors financial assets 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity 
F 33


# Page 216
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
to understand the reason for their disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for 
which the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Group’s continuous assessment of whether the business model for 
which the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has 
been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the classification of those assets. 
4.2 
Deﬁned employee beneﬁt assets and liabilities 
The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial 
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the 
future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly sensitive to changes 
in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
4.3 
Fair value measurement 
When the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based 
on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using various valuation techniques. The inputs to these 
models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required 
in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. 
Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of ﬁnancial instruments. 
4.4 
Impairment of financial assets 
The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement the estimation of the 
amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when determining impairment losses and the assessment of 
a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by several factors, changes in which can result in different 
levels of allowances. 
It has been the Group’s policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust when 
necessary.  
4.5 
Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method 
The Group’s EIR methodology, recognises interest income / expense using a rate of return that represents the best estimate 
of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of loans given / taken and recognises the effect of potentially 
different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments and 
penalty interest and charges). 
This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and lifecycle of the 
instruments, as well expected changes to India’s base rate and other fee income/expense that are integral parts of the 
instrument. 
4.6 
Lease Term 

The determination of lease term for some lease contracts in which the Group is a lessee, including whether the
Group is reasonably certain to exercise lessee options.

The determination of the incremental borrowing rate used to measure lease liabilities.
4.7 
Share based payments
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation 
model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most 
appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and 
making assumptions about them. 
4.8 
Other estimates 
These include contingent liabilities, useful lives of tangible and intangible assets etc.

The carrying amount of above assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
<This section has been  intentionally left blank>
The Group has sold some loans and advances as a source of finance. As per terms of the deal, risk and reward has been transferred to the customer. Hence, as per the derecognition criteria of IND AS 109,
including transfer of substantially all risks and rewards relating to assets being transferred to the buyer being met, the assets have been derecognised. The table below summarises the carrying amount of the
derecognised financial assets.
Under previous GAAP, retained interest receivable on loan assignment transactions were recognised over the period of such assigned loans. Under Ind AS, the gain arising on said transactions are recorded
upfront by discounting the future cash flows accruing in the form of differential interest on such assigned loan to their present values. 
The Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer. The Group securitised its mircofinance loans to different entities. These entities are not related to the Group. Also, the Group
neither holds any equity or other interest nor controls them. 
As per the terms of the agreement, the Group is exposed to first loss amounting to 7.25% - 12.5% (7.25% - 12% as at March 31, 2022) of the amount securitised and therefore continues to be exposed to
significant risk and rewards relating to the underlying gold and microfinance loans. These receivables are not derecognised and proceeds received are recorded as a financial liability under borrowings.
The table below outlines the carrying amounts and fair values of all financial assets transferred that are not derecognised in their entirety and associated liabilities.

(vii) The Company had filed a Writ Petition before the Honourable High Court of Madras on 30th July, 2019 challenging the Order passed by the Income Tax Settlement Commission, Chennai Bench
abating the proceedings before it relating to the Settlement Application filed by the Company dated December 17, 2017 (“Settlement Application”); and praying for stay on proceedings initiated by the
Joint Commissioner of Income Tax (OSD), Central Circle, Thiruvananthapuram post abatement of proceedings by the Settlement Commission. The tax and interest due on the issues forming part of the
Settlement Application totaled to ₹ 7,406 lakh. The Settlement Application related to notices received under Section 147 of the Income Tax Act, as per which the income chargeable to tax for the
Financial Years 2011-12 to 2016-17 of MFL has not been assessed, and Section 153A of the Income Tax Act, as per which MFL was required to prepare true and correct return of which MFL was
assessable for the Assessment Years 2011-2012 to 2016-2017. The Honourable High Court of Madras has dismissed the petition filed by the Company on June 29, 2022 on the ground that the cause of
action of the matter has arisen fully in Kerala and not within the territorial jurisdiction of the honourable Madras High Court, thereby ousting its jurisdiction to entertain the petition. Accordingly, the
Company has filed a writ petition before the Honorable High Court of Kerala proceedings of which are ongoing.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most
advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly
observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based
on a hierarchy of valuation techniques.

As at March 31, 2023
The fair value of financial instruments as referred to above have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the valuation
technique. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The equity instruments which are actively traded on public stock exchanges with readily available active prices on a regular basis are classified as
Level 1. Units held in mutual funds are measured based on their published net asset value (NAV), taking into account redemption and/or other
restrictions are generally Level 1. Equity instruments in non-listed entities are initially recognised at transaction price and re-measured as per fair
valuation report and valued on a case-by-case has been classified as Level 2.
For investment at fair value through profit and loss, valuation are done using quoted prices from active markets or on published Net Asset Values
of the investment at the measurement date or at the nearest available date. 
Investments in Security receipts (SRs) are classified as Financial Assets measured at FVTPL. Since the investment was made in the month of
March 2023 and the investment value approximates the net asset value as at March 31, 2023 as confirmed by the Asset Reconstruction Company
(ARC), disclosure of sensitivity of fair value measurement in unobservable inputs is not considered relevant. 
This level of hierarchy includes financial liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair
values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable
current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data, this level of hierarchy includes cumulative
compulsory convertible preference shares. 
The fair value of the CCCPS is measured using the Monte Carlo Simulation technique. The Monte Carlo Simulation Method is one where a risk-
neutral framework is used to simulate a range of simulated values, representing all the potential paths a variable could move over the period of the
simulation. The inputs to this model are taken from observable market where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is
exercised in establishing fair values. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

Loan receivables valuation is carried out for two portfolios segregated on the basis of repayment frequency – monthly and weekly. The valuation of
each portfolio is done by discounting the aggregate future cash flows with risk-adjusted discounting rate for the remaining portfolio tenor. 
Following inputs have been used to calculate the fair value of loans receivables:
(i) Future cash flows: Include principal receivable, interest receivable and tenor information based on the repayment schedule agreed with the
borrowers. Inputs include:
(ii) Risk-adjusted discount rate:
This rate has been arrived using the cost of funds approach.

Short-term financial assets and liabilities
Loans and advances to customers
Financial liability at amortised cost
For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts, which are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their
fair value. Such instruments include: cash and balances, trade receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents and trade payables without a specific maturity. Amounts have been
classified as Level 3 on the basis that no adjustments have been made to the balances in the balance sheet.
The fair values of loans and receivables are estimated by discounted cash flow models that incorporate assumptions for credit risks, probability of default and loss given default estimates. Since
comparable data is not available, credit risk is derived using historical experience, management view and other information used in its collective impairment models.
The fair values of financial liability held-to-maturity are estimated using a effective interest rate model based on contractual cash flows using actual yields. Since the cost of borrowing on the
reporting date is not expected to be significantly different from the actual yield considered under effective interest rate model, the carrying value of financial liabilities at amortised cost is
considered a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
Set out below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the financial statements. This table does
not include the fair values of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.
Particulars
Level
Carrying Value
Fair Value
Fair values of portfolios are calculated using a portfolio-based approach, grouping loans as far as possible into homogenous groups based on similar characteristics ie, type of loan. The Company
then calculates and extrapolates the fair value to the entire portfolio using Effective interest rate model that incorporate interest rate estimates considering all significant characteristics of the
loans. The credit risk is applied as a top-side adjustment based on the collective impairment model incorporating probability of defaults and loss given defaults. Hence, the carrying amount of
such financial assets at amortised cost net of impairment loss allowance is of reasonable approximation of their fair value.

scenario and the agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the changing risk landscape. The process of continuous evaluation of risks includes taking stock of the risk landscape on an
event-driven basis. The Group has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically adressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis.
The major type of risk Group faces in business are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk.
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group’s major income generating activity is gold loan, housing loan, microfinance loan 
personal loans and others.
The Group addressess credit risk through following major processess:
- Standardize the process of identifying new risks and designing appropriate controls for these risks
- Minimize losses due to defaults or untimely payments by borrowers
- Maintain an appropriate credit administration and loan review system 
- Establish metrics for portfolio monitoring
- Design appropriate credit risk mitigation techniques
- Structured and standardised credit approval process
- Verification of credit history from credit bureau agencies, personal verification of customers business and  residence
- Technical and Legal Verification
- Comprehensive credit risk assessment and cash flow analysis
In order to mitigate the impact of credit risk in the future profitability, the Company makes reserves basis the expected credit loss (ECL model) for the outstanding loans.
The Group’s impairment assessment and measurement approach is set out in this note. It should be read in conjunction with the Summary of significant accounting policies.
The Group considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.
As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Group also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such events occur, the Group carefully considers whether the event
should result in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate.
The Group considers a financial instrument as 'cured' and therefore re-classified out of Stage 3 during the year only once the entire dues have been received.

II) Liquidity risk
 Asset Liability Management (ALM)
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group may not meet its financial obligations. Liquidity risk arises due to the unavailability of adequate funds at an appropriate cost or tenure. The objective of liquidity risk management, is to 
maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Group consistently generates sufficient cash flows from operating and financial activities to meet its financial obligations as and when they 
fall due.  Our treasury team sources funds from multiple sources, including from banks, financial institutions, capital & retail markets to maintain a healthy mix of sources. They are responsible for diversifying fund raising sources, 
managing interest rate risks and maintaining a strong relationship with banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies, other domestic and foreign financial institutions and rating agencies to ensure the liquidity risk is 
well addressed.
The outstanding balance as at the reporting date is considered as EAD by the Group.
The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. To calculate the ECL for a Stage 1 loan, the Group assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the calculation of the 12
month ECL. For Stage 2 and Stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the instruments. The Group uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the
different products and schemes, the Group has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental 90 day DPD approach considering fresh slippage using historical information. 
Based on its review of macro-economic developments and economic outlook, the Group has assessed that no adjustment is required for temporary overlays to determine qualitative impact on its PD's as at 31st March 2023 and 31st
March 2022.
The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive.
When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Group applies the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
The internal rating model evaluates the loans on an ongoing basis. The rating model also assesses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the previously assigned risk grade. One key factor that indicates significant 
increase in credit risk is when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.

III) Market risk
Interest rate risk
Market Risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market factor. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the interest
rates and other market changes. The Group is exposed to two types of market risk as follows:
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group is  subject to interest rate risk, principally because we lend to clients at fixed interest 
rates and for periods that may differ from our funding sources, while our borrowings are at both fixed and variable interest rates for different periods.  We assess and manage our interest rate risk by managing our assets and liabilities. 
Our Asset Liability Management Committee evaluates asset liability management, and ensures that all significant mismatches, if any, are being managed appropriately.

Prepayment risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Group will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment earlier or later than expected.
Operational and business risk
<This section has been  intentionally left blank>
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to operate effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or
lead to financial loss. The Group cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but it endeavours to manage these risks through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include effective
segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, such as the use of internal audit.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion of  borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the profit before taxes affected through the impact on 
floating rate borrowings, debt securities and subordinate laibilities are as follows:
Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decreases as the result of changes in level of equity indices and individual stocks.  The trading and non-trading equity price risk  exposure arises from equity securities classified 
at FVTPL and FVOCI respectively”.
A 10% increase/(decrease) in the equity price (traded and non-traded) would have the impact as follows:

Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Management is satisfied that the Group shall be 
able to continue its business for the foreseeable future and no material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt 
on the going concern assumption. 
2.2 Presentation of financial Statements 
The Group presents its Balance Sheet in order of liquidity.  The Group prepares and presents its Balance Sheet, the 
Statement of Profit and Loss and the Statement of Changes in Equity in the format prescribed by Division III of Schedule 
III to the Act. The Statement of Cash Flows has been prepared and presented as per the requirements of Ind AS 7 
‘Statement of Cash Flows’. 
The Group generally reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis in the Balance Sheet. They are offset 
and reported net only when Ind AS specifically permits the same or it has an unconditional legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event. Similarly, the Group offsets incomes and 
expenses and reports the same on a net basis when permitted by Ind AS specifically unless they are material in nature. 
2.3 Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Company and all its subsidiaries, 
being the entities that it controls from the date control is gained. Control is evidenced where the investor is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the investee. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, 
which significantly affect the entity’s returns. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting 
year as the Parent Company. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align 
the accounting policies in line with accounting policies of the Parent Company. 
These consolidated financial statements are prepared on the following basis in accordance with Ind AS 110 on 
“Consolidated Financial Statements” specified under Section 133 of the Act. Following subsidiary companies have been 
considered in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 
i)
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through
its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the date on which controls commences until the date on which control ceases.
ii)
Non-controlling interest (“NCI”)
NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.
Changes in the Group’s equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as
equity transactions.
iii)
Loss of control
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and
any related NCI and other component of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at
fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit and
loss.

iv) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
The financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary used in the consolidation procedure are
drawn up to the same reporting date i.e. March 31, 2022. The financial statements of the Holding Company and
its subsidiary are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Intra-group balances and transactions, and unrealized income and expenses
arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as
unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. The Group follows uniform
accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. For additional information as
required by Paragraph 2 of the General Instructions for preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements to
Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, refer Note 49.
2.4 
Basis of measurement 
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for following assets and liabilities which 
have been measured at fair value: 
i)
Investments in equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
ii)
Financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
iii)
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
iv)
Investments which are held for trading
v)
Defined benefit plans.
2.5 
Functional and presentation currency 
The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR) which is also functional currency of the Group and the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. All values are rounded to the nearest lakhs, 
except when otherwise indicated.  
3.
Significant accounting policies
3.1 
Recognition of interest income
Interest income is recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial 
assets other than credit-impaired assets and financial assets classified as measured at FVTPL. 
 The EIR in case of a financial asset is computed  
a.
As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to
the gross carrying amount of a financial asset.
b.
By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.
c.
Including all fees received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate,
transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.
Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets. 
3.2 .  Recognition of revenue from sale of goods and services 
Revenue (other than for financial instruments) is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Ind 
AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers outlines a single comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising 
from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance found within Ind ASs. 
The Group recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in Ind 115: 
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that 
creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met. 
Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a 
customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. 
F 116

Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects 
to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties. 
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than 
one performance obligation, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that 
depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance 
obligation. 
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation 
Revenue from contract with customer for rendering services is recognised at a point in time when performance obligation 
is satisfied. 
3.2.1 
Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and the amount of the dividend can be measured 
reliably. 
3.2.2 
Rental Income 
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included 
in rental income in the statement of profit and loss, unless the increase is in line with expected general inflation, in which 
case lease income is recognised based on contractual terms. 
3.2.3 
Fees and commission income 
Fees and commission income such as service charges, commission from fee-based business lines, service income etc. are 
recognised on point in time basis. 
3.2.4 
Miscellaneous Income 
All other income is recognized on an accrual basis, when there is no uncertainty in the ultimate realization/collection. 
3.3 
Financial instruments  
A.
Financial Asset
3.3.1 
Initial recognition 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Loans are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account. Investments are recognised on the date when 
the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions. The Group recognises debt securities, deposits and borrowings 
when funds reach the Group and post allotment, where applicable. 
3.3.2 Initial and subsequent measurement of financial instruments 
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: 
1.
Debt instruments at amortised cost
2.
Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).
3.
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
4.
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI.
The classification depends on the contractual terms of the financial assets’ cash flows and the Group’s business model 
for managing financial assets which are explained below: 
Business model assessment 
The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to 
achieve its business objective. 
The Group's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated 
portfolios and is based on observable factors such as: 
F 117

Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
► How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated
and reported to the entity's key management personnel
► The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model)
and the way those risks are managed
► How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of
the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected)
► The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Group’s assessment.
► The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ 
scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group's
original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that
business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial
assets going forward.
The SPPI test 
As a second step of its classification process, the Group assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify 
whether they meet the SPPI test. 
‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may 
change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the 
premium/discount). 
In making this assessment, the Group considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending 
arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks 
and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure 
to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through the 
profit and loss account or is required to measure liabilities at fair value through profit or loss such as derivative liabilities. 
3.3.3 Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect
contractual cash flows and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement at fair value plus directly attributable costs, these financial assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by considering any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in 
interest income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in statement of profit and loss. 
3.3.4 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both the following conditions are 
met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect
contractual cash flows and selling the assets and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding
Debt instruments included within the FVOCI category are measured at each reporting date at fair value with such changes 
being recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI). The interest income on these assets is recognised in profit or 
loss. Impairment losses or reversals, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit and 
loss. Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified 
from equity to the income statement.

3.3.5 Financial Instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified 
as at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments that meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria but are designated 
as at FVTPL are measured at FVTPL. 
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVOCI criteria may be designated 
as at FVTPL upon initial recognition, if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition 
inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different 
bases. 
Group’s investment is classified as FVTPL, if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or 
repurchasing in the near term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for 
which there is evidence of short-term profit taking. 
Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value, with transaction costs 
recognised in the income statement as incurred. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value and any gains or losses are 
recognised in the income statement as they arise.  
3.3.6 Equity instruments 
The Group subsequently measures investment in equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, unless the Group’s 
management has elected to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI, when 
such instruments meet the definition of definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are 
not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Gains and losses on these equity instruments classified at FVOCI are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognised in profit or loss as dividend income when the right of the payment has been established, except when the 
Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are 
recorded in OCI.  
B. Financial Liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement 
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or the issue of financial liability, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are adjusted to fair value at initial 
recognition. 
Subsequent measurement  
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
3.4 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
3.4.1 
Financial Asset 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Group also derecognises 
the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.  
The Group has transferred the financial asset if, and only if, either: 
a)
The Group has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset
or
b)
It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full
without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass–through’ arrangement
Pass-through arrangements are transactions whereby the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows 
of a financial asset (the 'original asset'), but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more 
entities (the 'eventual recipients'), when all of the following three conditions are met: 
► The Group has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it has collected equivalent amounts
from the original asset, excluding short-term advances with the right to full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued
interest at market rates
F 119


# Page 302
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
► The Group cannot sell or pledge the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients
► The Group has to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay. In
addition, the Group is not entitled to reinvest such cash flows, except for investments in cash or cash equivalents
including interest earned, during the period between the collection date and the date of required remittance to the
eventual recipients.
A transfer only qualifies for derecognition if either: 
► The Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset
or
► The Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset
The Group considers control to be transferred if and only if, the transferee has the practical ability to sell the asset in 
its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without imposing additional 
restrictions on the transfer. 
When the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and has retained control of 
the asset, the asset continues to be recognised only to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement, in which case, 
the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a 
basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained. 
3.4.2 Financial Liability 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as de recognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability 
and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. 
3.5 Offsetting 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities 
are offset, and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and 
intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously in all the following 
circumstances: 
a.
The normal course of business
b.
The event of default
c.
The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group and/or its counter parties.
3.6 Impairment of financial assets 
3.6.1 
Overview of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) principles 
The Group has created provisions on all financial assets except for financial assets classified as FVTPL, based on the 
expected credit loss method. The Group also ensures maintaining the minimum provision requirement as per RBI and 
NHB regulations. 
The ECL provision is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit 
loss), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based 
on the 12 months’ expected credit loss. The 12-month ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs that 
result from default events on financial assets that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. 
The Group performs an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk 
has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the 
remaining life of the financial instrument. 
Based on the above process, the Group categorises its loans into three stages as described below: 
F 120


# Page 303
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
For non-impaired financial instruments 

Stage 1 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have not experienced a significant increase
in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. A 12-month ECL provision is made for stage 1 financial
instruments. In assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Group compares the risk of a default
occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date, with the risk of a default occurring on the financial
instrument as at the date of initial recognition.

Stage 2 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have experienced a SICR since initial
recognition. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for stage 2 financial instruments. In subsequent reporting
periods, if the credit risk of the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a SICR since initial
recognition, then entities recognize 12 months of ECL.
For impaired financial instruments: 
Financial instruments are classified as stage 3 when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more 
loss events that have occurred after initial recognition with a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows of a loan 
or a portfolio of loans. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for impaired financial instruments. 
3.6.2 
The calculation of ECLs 
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows: 
Probability of Default (PD) - The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time 
horizon. 
The Group uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products and schemes, 
the Group has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach 
considering fresh slippage using historical information.  
Exposure at Default (EAD) - The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering 
expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether 
scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed 
payments.  
Loss Given Default (LGD) – The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs 
at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect 
to receive.  
Forward looking information 
While estimating the expected credit losses, the Group reviews macro-economic developments occurring in the economy 
and market it operates in. On a periodic basis, the Group analyses if there is any relationship between key economic 
trends like GDP, unemployment rates, benchmark rates set by the Reserve Bank of India, inﬂation etc. with the estimate 
of PD, LGD determined by the Group based on its internal data. While the internal estimates of PD, LGD rates by the 
Group may not be always reﬂective of such relationships, temporary overlays, if any, are embedded in the methodology 
to reﬂect such macro-economic trends reasonably. 
Write-offs 
Loans are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case 
when it is determined that the customer does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufﬁcient cash 
ﬂows to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are credited to the 
statement of proﬁt and loss. 
Collateral 
To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Group seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in 
various forms, such as gold, cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, stock, current asset etc. However, the fair value 
of collateral affects the calculation of ECLs. The fair value of the same is based on data provided by third party or 
management judgements. 
F 121

Impairment of Trade receivables 
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The Group 
uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix 
is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables. 
3.7 Determination of fair value 
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, investments at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
i.
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
ii.
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability, if market participants act in their economic best interest. 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits 
by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use. 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which enough data are available 
to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
The financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as summarised below: 
Level 1 financial instruments − Those where the inputs used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group has access to at the measurement date. The Group considers 
markets as active only if there are sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical 
assets or liabilities and when there are binding and exercisable price quotes available on the balance sheet date. 
Level 2 financial instruments − Those where the inputs that are used for valuation and are significant, are derived from 
directly or indirectly observable market data available over the entire period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include 
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets 
and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit 
spreads. In addition, adjustments may be required for the condition or location of the asset or the extent to which it relates 
to items that are comparable to the valued instrument. However, if such adjustments are based on unobservable inputs 
which are significant to the entire measurement, the Group will classify the instruments as Level 3. 
Level 3 financial instruments − Those that include one or more unobservable input that is signiﬁcant to the measurement 
as whole. 
3.8 Foreign Currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the spot rate of ex-change ruling at 
the date of the transaction. However, for practical reasons, the Group uses an average rate if the average approximates 
the actual rate at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot 
rate of exchange at the reporting date. All differences arising on non–trading activities are taken to other income/expense 
in the statement of profit and loss.  
Non–monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange 
rates as at the date of recognition. 
3.9 Finance cost 
Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying 
amount of financial liabilities other than financial liabilities classified as FVTPL. 
F 122


# Page 305
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognized as part of the carrying value of the financial liability 
and amortized over the expected life using the effective interest method. These include fees and commissions payable 
to advisers and other expenses such as external legal costs, provided these are incremental costs that are directly related 
to the issue of a financial liability. 
3.10 Other income and expenses  
All Other income and expense are recognized in the period they occur. 
3.11  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand, short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less and forex balances, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short- term deposits, as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts, if any as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management. 
3.12   Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, 
(if any). The total cost of assets comprises its purchase price, freight, duties, taxes and any other incidental expenses 
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by the management.  
Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, 
and treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible asset are added to its gross value only if it increases the future 
benefits of the existing asset, beyond its previously assessed standards of performance and cost can be measured reliably. 
Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed off as and when incurred. 
3.13 Depreciation 
Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost comprises the purchase price and any 
attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.  
Depreciation is charged based on a review by the management during the year and at the rates derived based on the useful 
lives of the assets as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 or estimated useful lives estimated by the 
respective management based on technical evaluation. The holding company and one of its subsidiaries, Muthoot 
Microfin Limited follow the Straight Line Method for providing depreciation whereas the two other subsidiaries follow 
Written Down Value Method.  
Leasehold improvements and assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of lease term or their useful 
life. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each 
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
Property plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in other income / expense in the statement of profit and loss in the year 
the asset is derecognised. The date of disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the date the recipient obtains 
control of that item in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in 
Ind AS 115. 
3.14   Capital work-in-progress 
Capital work-in-progress are carried at cost, comprising direct cost and related incidental expenses. Assets which are not 
ready for intended use are also shown under capital work-in-progress. 
3.15    Intangible assets 
The Group’s intangible assets consist of computer software. 
F 123


# Page 306
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the expected future 
economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the Group. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises 
its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use and net of any 
trade discounts and rebates. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised by the Group over a period of 3 years, except in case of Muthoot Pappachan Technologies 
Limited where the computer software is amortised over a period of 10 years or over the estimated useful lives. 
Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. 
3.16   Investment Property 
Properties, held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation are classified as investment property and measured and reported 
at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the assets carrying amount only when it is 
probable that the future economic benefit associated with the expenditure will flow to the company. 
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from 
use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of property 
is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the same period. 
3.17 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Groups assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal 
and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset 
or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining 
fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are considered. If no such transactions can be identified, an 
appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for 
publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the 
assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal 
is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which 
case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. 
3.18 
Post-employment benefits 
3.18.1 Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to the Employees Provident Fund Scheme maintained by the Central Government, Employee State 
Insurance Corporation (ESIC) etc. are accounted for on an accrual basis. Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund 
is a defined contribution scheme.  
The Group has no obligation, other than the contribution payable under the schemes. The Group recognizes contribution 
payable to the provident fund scheme / ESIC as expenditure, when an employee renders the related service. If the 
contribution payable to the scheme / ESIC for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution 
already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. 
F 124


# Page 307
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then 
excess is recognized as an asset. 
3.18.2 
Defined Benefit schemes 
Gratuity 
The Group provides for gratuity covering eligible employees under which a lump sum payment is paid to vested 
employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount reckoned on the respective 
employee’s salary and his tenor of employment with the Group. The Group accounts for its liability for future gratuity 
benefits based on actuarial valuation determined at each Balance Sheet date by an Independent Actuary using Projected 
Unit Credit Method. The Group makes contributions to a Gratuity Fund administered by the Life Insurance Corporation 
of India.  
The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining 
the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan are based on the market yields on Government Securities 
as at the Balance Sheet date.     
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities 
involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. 
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net deﬁned 
beneﬁt liability), are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to other equity 
through OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassiﬁed to statement of proﬁt and loss in 
subsequent periods. 
3.19 
Share Based Payments 
The Group has formulated an Employees Stock Option Scheme to be administered through respective Trusts for its 
subsidiaries MML and MHFCL. The fair value of options granted under Employee Stock Option Plan is recognised as 
an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in other equity. The total amount to be expensed is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the options. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is 
the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the estimates 
of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting and service conditions are revised. It 
recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in Statement of Profit and Loss, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity. 
3.20 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the enterprise determines the level of provision by discounting 
the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific to the liability. The expense relating to any 
provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. 
3.21 
Assets held for sale 
Assets possessed against the settlement of loans are carried in the balance sheet at a value of outstanding principal loan 
amount or fair value of asset whichever is lower. In case the fair value of the asset acquired is lower than the outstanding 
principal loan amount; then the shortfall is to be provided for in the books of account in such financial year. 
These assets are classified as ‘Assets held for sale’ under ‘Non-financial assets’ till the asset acquired is finally disposed. 
The outstanding overdue interest and other charges will be accounted on realization basis.  
Further, if on disposal of the assets so acquired, the sale proceed is higher than the receivable amount (including 
outstanding loan, outstanding overdue interest, other charges and interest), then the Company will refund the excess 
amount to the borrowers.

Taxes 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
3.21.1 Current Tax 
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of taxable profit for a period. Taxable profit differs from 
‘profit before tax’ as reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws.  
Interest income / expenses and penalties, if any, related to income tax are included in current tax expense. The tax rates 
and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of reporting date 
in India where the Group operates and generates taxable income. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either 
in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
3.22.2 Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is probable 
that future taxable amounts will arise to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax assets are reviewed 
at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities are realised 
simultaneously. 
3.22.3 Goods and services tax /value added taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses 
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the goods and services tax/value added taxes paid, except: 
i.
When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in
which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense
item, as applicable
ii.
When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included
The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the balance sheet. 
3.23 
Contingent Liabilities and assets 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present 
obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized 
because it cannot be measured reliably. The Group does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in 
the ﬁnancial statements. 
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be conﬁrmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity. The 
Group does not have any contingent assets in the ﬁnancial statements.

3.24 
Earnings Per Share 
The Group reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic EPS 
is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting preference 
dividend and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity 
shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have been 
issued at a later date. In computing the dilutive earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that 
either reduces the earnings per share or increases loss per share are included. 
3.25 
Dividends on ordinary shares 
The Group recognises a liability to make distributions to equity holders of the Group when the distribution is authorised, 
and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is 
authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. 
3.26 
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement 
and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or 
assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
Group as a lessee 
The Groups lease asset class consists of building, equipment and vehicles. The Group assesses whether a contract contains 
a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group has, at the date of transition, recognized 
a right-of use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less (short term lease) and low value assets. For these short-term and low value leases, 
the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  
The right-of-use assets are recognized at cost, which comprises the present value of the lease liability as at the date of 
transition. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the balance lease term and useful 
life of the underlying asset. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future 
lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit on the lease or, if not readily 
determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates. Interest accrued on lease liability and lease payments made, are 
subsequently adjusted to the initial recognition of lease liability. 
Group as a lessor 
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased 
items are operating leases. Rental Income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the 
lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss. 
3.27 
Cash flow statement 
Cash flows are reported using indirect method, whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions 
of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments and items of income or 
expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from regular revenue generating (operating 
activities), investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. 
4. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the 
accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimates are revised, and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the 
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could 
result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods.

Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognized in the ﬁnancial statements is included in the 
following notes: 
4.1 
Business Model Assessment 
Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The 
Group determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to 
achieve a business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the 
performance of the assets is evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets 
and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Group monitors financial assets 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity 
to understand the reason for their disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for 
which the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Group’s continuous assessment of whether the business model for 
which the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has 
been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the classification of those assets. 
4.2 
Deﬁned employee beneﬁt assets and liabilities 
The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial 
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the 
future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly sensitive to changes 
in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
4.3 
Fair value measurement 
When the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based 
on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using various valuation techniques. The inputs to these 
models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required 
in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. 
Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of ﬁnancial instruments. 
4.4 
Impairment of financial assets 
The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement the estimation of the 
amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when determining impairment losses and the assessment of 
a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by several factors, changes in which can result in different 
levels of allowances. 
It has been the Group’s policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust when 
necessary.  
4.5 
Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method 
The Group’s EIR methodology, recognises interest income / expense using a rate of return that represents the best estimate 
of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of loans given / taken and recognises the effect of potentially 
different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments and 
penalty interest and charges). 
This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and lifecycle of the 
instruments, as well expected changes to India’s base rate and other fee income/expense that are integral parts of the 
instrument. 
4.6 
Lease Term 

The determination of lease term for some lease contracts in which the Company is a lessee, including whether the
Company is reasonably certain to exercise lessee options.

The determination of the incremental borrowing rate used to measure lease liabilities.
4.7 
Share based payments
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation 
model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most

appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and 
making assumptions about them. 
4.8 
Other estimates 
These include contingent liabilities, useful lives of tangible and intangible assets etc.

The carrying amount of above assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
<This section has been  intentionally left blank>
The Group has sold some loans and advances as a source of finance. As per terms of the deal, risk and reward has been transferred to the customer. Hence, as per the derecognition criteria of IND AS 109,
including transfer of substantially all risks and rewards relating to assets being transferred to the buyer being met, the assets have been derecognised. The table below summarises the carrying amount of the
derecognised financial assets.
Under previous GAAP, retained interest receivable on loan assignment transactions were recognised over the period of such assigned loans. Under Ind AS, the gain arising on said transactions are recorded
upfront by discounting the future cash flows accruing in the form of differential interest on such assigned loan to their present values. 
The Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer. The Group securitised its mircofinance loans to different entities. These entities are not related to the Group. Also, the Group
neither holds any equity or other interest nor controls them. 
As per the terms of the agreement, the Group is exposed to first loss amounting to 7.25% - 12% (7.25% - 10% as at March 31, 2021) of the amount securitised and therefore continues to be exposed to significant
risk and rewards relating to the underlying gold and microfinance loans. These receivables are not derecognised and proceeds received are recorded as a financial liability under borrowings.
The table below outlines the carrying amounts and fair values of all financial assets transferred that are not derecognised in their entirety and associated liabilities.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most
advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly
observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based
on a hierarchy of valuation techniques.

Particulars
At FVTOCI
As at March 31, 2022
The fair value of financial instruments as referred to above have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the valuation
technique. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The equity instruments which are actively traded on public stock exchanges with readily available active prices on a regular basis are classified as
Level 1. Units held in mutual funds are measured based on their published net asset value (NAV), taking into account redemption and/or other
restrictions are generally Level 1. Equity instruments in non-listed entities are initially recognised at transaction price and re-measured as per fair
valuation report and valued on a case-by-case has been classified as Level 2.
For investment at fair value through profit and loss, valuation are done using quoted prices from active markets or on published Net Asset Values
of the investment at the measurement date or at the nearest available date. 
This level of hierarchy includes financial liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair
values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable
current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data, this level of hierarchy includes cumulative
compulsory convertible preference shares. 
The fair value of the CCCPS is measured using the Monte Carlo Simulation technique. The Monte Carlo Simulation Method is one where a risk-
neutral framework is used to simulate a range of simulated values, representing all the potential paths a variable could move over the period of the
simulation. The inputs to this model are taken from observable market where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is
exercised in establishing fair values. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

of each portfolio is done by discounting the aggregate future cash flows with risk-adjusted discounting rate for the remaining portfolio tenor. 
Following inputs have been used to calculate the fair value of loans receivables:
(i) Future cash flows: Include principal receivable, interest receivable and tenor information based on the repayment schedule agreed with the
borrowers. Inputs include:
(ii) Risk-adjusted discount rate:
This rate has been arrived using the cost of funds approach.

Valuation techniques
Short-term financial assets and liabilities
Loans and advances to customers
Financial liability at amortised cost
For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts, which are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their
fair value. Such instruments include: cash and balances, Trade receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents and trade payables without a specific maturity. Such amounts have been
classified as Level 3 on the basis that no adjustments have been made to the balances in the balance sheet.
The fair values of loans and receivables are estimated by discounted cash flow models that incorporate assumptions for credit risks, probability of default and loss given default estimates. Since
comparable data is not available, credit risk is derived using historical experience, management view and other information used in its collective impairment models.
The fair values of financial liability held-to-maturity are estimated using a effective interest rate model based on contractual cash flows using actual yields. Since the cost of borrowing on the
reporting date is not expected to be significantly different from the actual yield considered under effective interest rate model, the carrying value of financial liabilities at amortised cost is
considered a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
Set out below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the financial statements. This table does
not include the fair values of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.
Particulars
Level
Carrying Value
Fair Value
Fair values of portfolios are calculated using a portfolio-based approach, grouping loans as far as possible into homogenous groups based on similar characteristics ie, type of loan. The Company
then calculates and extrapolates the fair value to the entire portfolio using Effective interest rate model that incorporate interest rate estimates considering all significant characteristics of the
loans. The credit risk is applied as a top-side adjustment based on the collective impairment model incorporating probability of defaults and loss given defaults. Hence, the carrying amount of
such financial assets at amortised cost net of impairment loss allowance is of reasonable approximation of their fair value.

The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise of borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the Group’s operations. The Group’s principal financial assets
include loans, investments, cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other receivables that derive directly from its operations. 
As a financial lending institution, Group is exposed to various risks that are related to lending business and operating environment. The principal objective in Group's risk management processes is to measure and monitor the various
risks that Group is subject to and to follow policies and procedures to address such risks. 
The Groups Risk Management Committee (RMC) comprise of the Board of directors constituted in accordance with the RBI rules. The RMC has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Risk Management Policy.
The committee meets on a quarterly basis to review the risk management practices and working of the risk management department. The committee is chaired by an Independent Director. Risk Management Department periodically
places its report to the committee for review. The committee’s suggestions for improving the risk management practices are implemented by the Risk Management Department.  
The Group has implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to assess, monitor and manage risk throughout the Group. The risk management process is continuously reviewed, improved and adapted in the changing risk
scenario and the agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the changing risk landscape. The process of continuous evaluation of risks includes taking stock of the risk landscape on an
event-driven basis. The Group has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically adressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis.
The major type of risk Group faces in business are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk.
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group’s major income generating activity is gold loan, housing loan, microfinance loan 
personal loans and others.
The Group addressess credit risk through following major processess:
- Standardize the process of identifying new risks and designing appropriate controls for these risks
- Minimize losses due to defaults or untimely payments by borrowers
- Maintain an appropriate credit administration and loan review system 
- Establish metrics for portfolio monitoring
- Design appropriate credit risk mitigation techniques
- Structured and standardised credit approval process
- Verification of credit history from credit bureau agencies, personal verification of customers business and  residence
- Technical and Legal Verification
- Comprehensive credit risk assessment and cash flow analysis
In order to mitigate the impact of credit risk in the future profitability, the Company makes reserves basis the expected credit loss (ECL model) for the outstanding loans.
The Group’s impairment assessment and measurement approach is set out in this note. It should be read in conjunction with the Summary of significant accounting policies.
The Group considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.
As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Group also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such events occur, the Group carefully considers whether the event
should result in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate.
It is the Group’s policy to consider a financial instrument as ‘cured’ and therefore re-classified out of Stage 3 when none of the default criteria have been present for at least three consecutive months. The decision whether to classify an
asset as Stage 2 or Stage 1 once cured depends on the updated credit grade, at the time of the cure, and whether this indicates there has been a significant increase in credit risk compared to initial recognition.

Significant Increase in credit risk
II) Liquidity risk
 Asset Liability Management (ALM)
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group may not meet its financial obligations. Liquidity risk arises due to the unavailability of adequate funds at an appropriate cost or tenure. The objective of liquidity risk management, is to 
maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Group consistently generates sufficient cash flows from operating and financial activities to meet its financial obligations as and when they 
fall due.  Our resource mobilisation team sources funds from multiple sources, including from banks, financial institutions, capital & retail markets to maintain a healthy mix of sources. The resource mobilisation team is responsible for 
diversifying fund raising sources, managing interest rate risks and maintaining a strong relationship with banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies, other domestic and foreign financial institutions and rating 
agencies to ensure the liquidity risk is well addressed.
The outstanding balance as at the reporting date is considered as EAD by the Group.
The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. To calculate the ECL for a Stage 1 loan, the Group assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the calculation of the 12
month ECL. For Stage 2 and Stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the instruments. The Group uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the
different products and schemes, the Group has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental 90 day DPD approach considering fresh slippage using historical information. 
Based on its review of macro-economic developments and economic outlook, the Group has assessed that no adjustment is required for temporary overlays to determine qualitative impact on its PD's as at 31st March 2022 and 31st
March 2021.
The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive.
When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Group applies the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
The internal rating model evaluates the loans on an ongoing basis. The rating model also assesses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the previously assigned risk grade. One key factor that indicates significant 
increase in credit risk is when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.

III) Market risk
Interest rate risk
Market Risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market factor. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the interest
rates and other market changes. The Group is exposed to two types of market risk as follows:
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group is  subject to interest rate risk, principally because we lend to clients at fixed interest 
rates and for periods that may differ from our funding sources, while our borrowings are at both fixed and variable interest rates for different periods.  We assess and manage our interest rate risk by managing our assets and liabilities. 
Our Asset Liability Management Committee evaluates asset liability management, and ensures that all significant mismatches, if any, are being managed appropriately.

Prepayment risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Group will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment earlier or later than expected.
Operational and business risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to operate effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or
lead to financial loss. The Group cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but it endeavours to manage these risks through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include effective
segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, such as the use of internal audit.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion of  borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the profit before taxes affected through the impact on 
floating rate borrowings, debt securities and subordinate laibilities are as follows:
Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decreases as the result of changes in level of equity indices and individual stocks.  The trading and non-trading equity price risk  exposure arises from equity securities classified 
at FVTPL and FVOCI respectively”.
A 10% increase/(decrease) in the equity price (traded and non-traded) would have the impact as follows:

44 Impact of Covid-19
The after effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant restrictions have continued to have its impact on economic activity during the year ended March 31, 2022. However, this has not resulted in a significant impact on the
operations / financial position of the Group, though there has been an expected level of stress in collections and higher gold auctions during the year. 
The Group continues to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its liquidity and ability to repay its obligations as and when they fall due and the management believes that the Group will be able to pay its obligations as and
when these become due in the foreseeable future. The Group would continue to focus on maintaining adequate capital and ensuring liquidity at all points in time. The Group has recorded a management overlay allowance of INR
4,796.75 (P.Y. INR 4,613.89) in its Expected Credit Loss provision in view of the circumstances following the pandemic, based on the information available at this time.

Information other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report thereon 
The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The 
other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not 
include the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements, Standalone Ind AS Financial 
Statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Annual Report is expected to be made 
available to us after the date of this auditor's report. 
Our opinion on the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements does not cover the other 
information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information, compare with the financial statements of the 
subsidiaries audited by the other auditors, to the extent lt relates to this entity and, in doing 
so, place reliance on the work of the other auditors and consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Ind AS FinanciaJ Statements 
or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. Other information so far as it relates to subsidiary companies, is 
traced from their financial statements audited by the other auditors. 
When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance. 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements 
The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 
134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these Consolidated 
Ind AS Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and 
consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles 
generalJy accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under section 
133 of the Act. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group 
are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing and 
'detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate

accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that 
were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give 
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. 
In preparing the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements, the respective Board of 
Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing the Group's 
ability to continue as a going concern, disdosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management either 
intends to liquidate or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are also 
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group. 
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Ind AS 
Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit We also: 
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that js sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the
Companies Act, 2013, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the
Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the
operating effectiveness of such controls.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management
- • Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
5 
F 190


# Page 373
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are requir.ed to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the 
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor's report However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
continue as a going concern. 
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Ind AS
Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Ind AS
Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the audit of the financial statements of such entities or business activities included in the
consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the
subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by
other auditors, such other auditor shall remain responsible for the direction, supervision
and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our
audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Consolidated Ind AS Financial 
Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements may 
be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and to evaluate the effect 
of any identified misstatements in the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements. 
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during 
our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied 
with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with 
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial 
Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about 
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because of the adverse consequences of doing so would 
b_e.re sonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021, we have audited the internal
financial controls over financial reporting of Muthoot Fincorp Limited (hereinafter
referred to as "the Holding Company') and its subsidiary companies, which includes
internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies,
are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the
internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the respective Companies
considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on
Audit of lnternal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of r ndia. These responsibilities include the design, implementation
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the
respective company's policies, the safeguardjng of its assets, the prevention and detection
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act,
2013. 
Audi tors' Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls over financiaJ
reporting of the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies, based on our audit We
conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial
Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing,
both issued by the ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the
Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls.

the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating �ffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by 
the other auditors of the subsidiary companies are sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion on the Group's internal financial controls system over financial 
reporting. 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial 
reporting includes those policies and procedures that; (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting princip]es, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acqujsition, use, or disposition of 
the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal .financial controls over financial reporting, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial 
reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Opinion 
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us 
and based on the consideration of tbe reports of the other auditors referred to in the Other 
Matters paragraph below, the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies, have, in all 
material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting 
and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as 
at March 31, 2021, based on the criteria for internal financial control over financial 
reporting established by the respective companies considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the r nstitute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Management is satisfied that the Group shall be 
able to continue its business for the foreseeable future and no material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt 
on the going concern assumption. 
2.2 Presentation of financial Statements 
The Group presents its Balance Sheet in order of liquidity.  The Group prepares and presents its Balance Sheet, the 
Statement of Profit and Loss and the Statement of Changes in Equity in the format prescribed by Division III of Schedule 
III to the Act. The Statement of Cash Flows has been prepared and presented as per the requirements of Ind AS 7 
‘Statement of Cash Flows’. 
The Group generally reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis in the Balance Sheet. They are offset 
and reported net only when Ind AS specifically permits the same or it has an unconditional legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event. Similarly, the Group offsets incomes and 
expenses and reports the same on a net basis when permitted by Ind AS specifically unless they are material in nature. 
2.3 Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Company and all its subsidiaries, 
being the entities that it controls from the date control is gained. Control is evidenced where the investor is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the investee. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, 
which significantly affect the entity’s returns. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting 
year as the Parent Company. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align 
the accounting policies in line with accounting policies of the Parent Company. 
These consolidated financial statements are prepared on the following basis in accordance with Ind AS 110 on 
“Consolidated Financial Statements” specified under Section 133 of the Act. Following subsidiary companies have been 
considered in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 
i)
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through
its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the date on which controls commences until the date on which control ceases.
ii)
Non-controlling interest (“NCI”)
NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.
Changes in the Group’s equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as
equity transactions.
iii)
Loss of control
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and
any related NCI and other component of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at
fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit and
loss.

iv) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
The financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary used in the consolidation procedure are
drawn up to the same reporting date i.e. 31 March 2021. The financial statements of the Holding Company and
its subsidiary are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Intra-group balances and transactions, and unrealized income and expenses
arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as
unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. The Group follows uniform
accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. For additional information as
required by Paragraph 2 of the General Instructions for preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements to
Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, refer Note 50.
2.4 
Basis of measurement 
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for following assets and liabilities which 
have been measured at fair value: 
i)
Investments in equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
ii)
Financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
iii)
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
iv)
Investments which are held for trading
v)
Defined benefit plans.
2.5 
Functional and presentation currency 
The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR) which is also functional currency of the Group and the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. All values are rounded to the nearest lakhs, 
except when otherwise indicated.  
3.
Significant accounting policies
3.1 
Recognition of interest income
Interest income is recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial 
assets other than credit-impaired assets and financial assets classified as measured at FVTPL. 
 The EIR in case of a financial asset is computed  
a.
As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to
the gross carrying amount of a financial asset.
b.
By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.
c.
Including all fees received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate,
transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.
Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets. 
Interest income on credit impaired assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the net amortised cost 
(net of provision) of the financial asset. 
3.2 .  Recognition of revenue from sale of goods and services 
Revenue (other than for financial instruments) is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Ind 
AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers outlines a single comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising 
from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance found within Ind ASs. 
The Group recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in Ind 115: 
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that 
creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met. 
Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a 
customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. 
F 203


# Page 386
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects 
to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties. 
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than 
one performance obligation, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that 
depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance 
obligation. 
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation 
Revenue from contract with customer for rendering services is recognised at a point in time when performance obligation 
is satisfied. 
3.2.1 
Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and the amount of the dividend can be measured 
reliably. 
3.2.2 
Rental Income 
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included 
in rental income in the statement of profit and loss, unless the increase is in line with expected general inflation, in which 
case lease income is recognised based on contractual terms. 
3.2.3 
Fees and commission income 
Fees and commission income such as service charges, commission from fee-based business lines, service income etc. are 
recognised on point in time basis. 
3.2.4 
Miscellaneous Income 
All other income is recognized on an accrual basis, when there is no uncertainty in the ultimate realization/collection. 
3.3 
Financial instruments  
A.
Financial Asset
3.3.1 
Initial recognition 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Loans are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account. Investments are recognised on the date when 
the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions. The Group recognises debt securities, deposits and borrowings 
when funds reach the Group and post allotment, where applicable. 
3.3.2 Initial and subsequent measurement of financial instruments 
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: 
1.
Debt instruments at amortised cost
2.
Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).
3.
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
4.
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI.
The classification depends on the contractual terms of the financial assets’ cash flows and the Group’s business model 
for managing financial assets which are explained below: 
Business model assessment 
The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to 
achieve its business objective. 
The Group's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated 
portfolios and is based on observable factors such as: 
F 204


# Page 387
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
► How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated
and reported to the entity's key management personnel
► The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model)
and the way those risks are managed
► How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of
the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected)
► The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Group’s assessment.
► The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ 
scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group's
original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that
business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial
assets going forward.
The SPPI test 
As a second step of its classification process, the Group assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify 
whether they meet the SPPI test. 
‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may 
change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the 
premium/discount). 
In making this assessment, the Group considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending 
arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks 
and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure 
to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through the 
profit and loss account or is required to measure liabilities at fair value through profit or loss such as derivative liabilities. 
3.3.3 Financial assets measured at amortised cost 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect
contractual cash flows and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement at fair value plus directly attributable costs, these financial assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by considering any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in 
interest income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in statement of profit and loss. 
3.3.4 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
A 'debt instrument' is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both the following conditions are 
met: 
a.
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect
contractual cash flows and selling the assets and
b.
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding
Debt instruments included within the FVOCI category are measured at each reporting date at fair value with such changes 
being recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI). The interest income on these assets is recognised in profit or 
loss. Impairment losses or reversals, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit and 
loss. Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified 
from equity to the income statement.  
F 205


# Page 388
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
3.3.5 Financial Instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified 
as at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments that meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria but are designated 
as at FVTPL are measured at FVTPL. 
A financial asset that meets the amortised cost criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVOCI criteria may be designated 
as at FVTPL upon initial recognition, if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition 
inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different 
bases. 
Group’s investment is classified as FVTPL, if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or 
repurchasing in the near term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for 
which there is evidence of short-term profit taking. 
Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value, with transaction costs 
recognised in the income statement as incurred. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value and any gains or losses are 
recognised in the income statement as they arise.  
3.3.6 Equity instruments 
The Group subsequently measures investment in equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, unless the Group’s 
management has elected to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI, when 
such instruments meet the definition of definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are 
not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Gains and losses on these equity instruments classified at FVOCI are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognised in profit or loss as dividend income when the right of the payment has been established, except when the 
Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are 
recorded in OCI.  
B. Financial Liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement 
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or the issue of financial liability, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are adjusted to fair value at initial 
recognition. 
Subsequent measurement  
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
3.4 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
3.4.1 
Financial Asset 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Group also derecognises 
the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.  
The Group has transferred the financial asset if, and only if, either: 
a)
The Group has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset
or
b)
It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full
without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass–through’ arrangement
Pass-through arrangements are transactions whereby the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows 
of a financial asset (the 'original asset'), but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more 
entities (the 'eventual recipients'), when all of the following three conditions are met: 
► The Group has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it has collected equivalent amounts
from the original asset, excluding short-term advances with the right to full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued
interest at market rates
F 206


# Page 389
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
► The Group cannot sell or pledge the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients
► The Group has to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay. In
addition, the Group is not entitled to reinvest such cash flows, except for investments in cash or cash equivalents
including interest earned, during the period between the collection date and the date of required remittance to the
eventual recipients.
A transfer only qualifies for derecognition if either: 
► The Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset
or
► The Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset
The Group considers control to be transferred if and only if, the transferee has the practical ability to sell the asset in 
its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without imposing additional 
restrictions on the transfer. 
When the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and has retained control of 
the asset, the asset continues to be recognised only to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement, in which case, 
the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a 
basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained. 
3.4.2 Financial Liability 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as de recognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability 
and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. 
3.5 Offsetting 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities 
are offset, and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and 
intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously in all the following 
circumstances: 
a.
The normal course of business
b.
The event of default
c.
The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group and/or its counter parties.
3.6 Impairment of financial assets 
3.6.1 
Overview of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) principles 
The Group has created provisions on all financial assets except for financial assets classified as FVTPL, based on the 
expected credit loss method. The Group also ensures maintaining the minimum provision requirement as per RBI and 
NHB regulations. 
The ECL provision is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit 
loss), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based 
on the 12 months’ expected credit loss. The 12-month ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs that 
result from default events on financial assets that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. 
The Group performs an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk 
has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the 
remaining life of the financial instrument. 
Based on the above process, the Group categorises its loans into three stages as described below: 
F 207


# Page 390
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
For non-impaired financial instruments 

Stage 1 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have not experienced a significant increase
in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. A 12-month ECL provision is made for stage 1 financial
instruments. In assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Group compares the risk of a default
occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date, with the risk of a default occurring on the financial
instrument as at the date of initial recognition.

Stage 2 is comprised of all non-impaired financial instruments which have experienced a SICR since initial
recognition. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for stage 2 financial instruments. In subsequent reporting
periods, if the credit risk of the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a SICR since initial
recognition, then entities recognize 12 months of ECL.
For impaired financial instruments: 
Financial instruments are classified as stage 3 when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more 
loss events that have occurred after initial recognition with a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows of a loan 
or a portfolio of loans. The Group recognises lifetime ECL for impaired financial instruments. 
3.6.2 
The calculation of ECLs 
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows: 
Probability of Default (PD) - The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time 
horizon. 
The Group uses historical information where available to determine PD. Considering the different products and schemes, 
the Group has bifurcated its loan portfolio into various pools. PD is calculated using Incremental NPA approach 
considering fresh slippage using historical information.  
Exposure at Default (EAD) - The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering 
expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether 
scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed 
payments.  
Loss Given Default (LGD) – The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs 
at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect

Forward looking information 
While estimating the expected credit losses, the Group reviews macro-economic developments occurring in the economy 
and market it operates in. On a periodic basis, the Group analyses if there is any relationship between key economic 
trends like GDP, unemployment rates, benchmark rates set by the Reserve Bank of India, inﬂation etc. with the estimate 
of PD, LGD determined by the Group based on its internal data. While the internal estimates of PD, LGD rates by the 
Group may not be always reﬂective of such relationships, temporary overlays, if any, are embedded in the methodology 
to reﬂect such macro-economic trends reasonably. 
Write-offs 
Loans are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case 
when it is determined that the customer does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufﬁcient cash 
ﬂows to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are credited to the 
statement of proﬁt and loss. 
Collateral 
To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Group seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in 
various forms, such as gold, cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, stock, current asset etc. However, the fair value 
of collateral affects the calculation of ECLs. The fair value of the same is based on data provided by third party or 
management judgements.

Impairment of Trade receivables 
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The Group 
uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix 
is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables. 
3.7 Determination of fair value 
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, investments at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
i.
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
ii.
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability, if market participants act in their economic best interest. 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits 
by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use. 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which enough data are available 
to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
The financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as summarised below: 
Level 1 financial instruments − Those where the inputs used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group has access to at the measurement date. The Group considers 
markets as active only if there are sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical 
assets or liabilities and when there are binding and exercisable price quotes available on the balance sheet date. 
Level 2 financial instruments − Those where the inputs that are used for valuation and are significant, are derived from 
directly or indirectly observable market data available over the entire period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include 
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets 
and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit 
spreads. In addition, adjustments may be required for the condition or location of the asset or the extent to which it relates 
to items that are comparable to the valued instrument. However, if such adjustments are based on unobservable inputs 
which are significant to the entire measurement, the Group will classify the instruments as Level 3. 
Level 3 financial instruments − Those that include one or more unobservable input that is signiﬁcant to the measurement 
as whole. 
3.8 Foreign Currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the spot rate of ex-change ruling at 
the date of the transaction. However, for practical reasons, the Group uses an average rate if the average approximates 
the actual rate at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot 
rate of exchange at the reporting date. All differences arising on non–trading activities are taken to other income/expense 
in the statement of profit and loss.  
Non–monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange 
rates as at the date of recognition. 
3.9 Finance cost 
Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying 
amount of financial liabilities other than financial liabilities classified as FVTPL. 
F 209


# Page 392
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognized as part of the carrying value of the financial liability 
and amortized over the expected life using the effective interest method. These include fees and commissions payable 
to advisers and other expenses such as external legal costs, provided these are incremental costs that are directly related 
to the issue of a financial liability. 
3.10 Other income and expenses  
All Other income and expense are recognized in the period they occur. 
3.11  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand, short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less and forex balances, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short- term deposits, as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts, if any as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management. 
3.12   Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, 
(if any). The total cost of assets comprises its purchase price, freight, duties, taxes and any other incidental expenses 
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by the management.  
Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, 
and treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible asset are added to its gross value only if it increases the future 
benefits of the existing asset, beyond its previously assessed standards of performance and cost can be measured reliably. 
Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed off as and when incurred. 
3.13 Depreciation 
Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost comprises the purchase price and any 
attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.  
Depreciation is charged based on a review by the management during the year and at the rates derived based on the useful 
lives of the assets as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 or estimated useful lives estimated by the 
respective management based on technical evaluation. The holding company and one of its subsidiaries, Muthoot 
Microfin Limited follow the Straight Line Method for providing depreciation whereas the two other subsidiaries follow 
Written Down Value Method.  
Leasehold improvements and assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of lease term or their useful 
life. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each 
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
Property plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in other income / expense in the statement of profit and loss in the year 
the asset is derecognised. The date of disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the date the recipient obtains 
control of that item in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in 
Ind AS 115. 
3.14   Capital work-in-progress 
Capital work-in-progress are carried at cost, comprising direct cost and related incidental expenses. Assets which are not 
ready for intended use are also shown under capital work-in-progress. 
3.15    Intangible assets 
The Group’s intangible assets consist of computer software. 
F 210


# Page 393
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the expected future 
economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the Group. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises 
its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use and net of any 
trade discounts and rebates. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised by the Group over a period of 3 years, except in case of Muthoot Pappachan Technologies 
Limited where the computer software is amortised over a period of 10 years or over the estimated useful lives. 
Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. 
3.16   Investment Property 
Properties, held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation are classified as investment property and measured and reported 
at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the assets carrying amount only when it is 
probable that the future economic benefit associated with the expenditure will flow to the company. 
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from 
use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of property 
is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the same period. 
3.17 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Groups assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal 
and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset 
or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining 
fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are considered. If no such transactions can be identified, an 
appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for 
publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the 
assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal 
is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which 
case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. 
3.18 
Post-employment benefits 
3.18.1 Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to the Employees Provident Fund Scheme maintained by the Central Government, Employee State 
Insurance Corporation (ESIC) etc. are accounted for on an accrual basis. Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund 
is a defined contribution scheme.  
The Group has no obligation, other than the contribution payable under the schemes. The Group recognizes contribution 
payable to the provident fund scheme / ESIC as expenditure, when an employee renders the related service. If the 
contribution payable to the scheme / ESIC for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution 
already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. 
F 211


# Page 394
Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then 
excess is recognized as an asset. 
3.18.2 
Defined Benefit schemes 
Gratuity 
The Group provides for gratuity covering eligible employees under which a lump sum payment is paid to vested 
employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount reckoned on the respective 
employee’s salary and his tenor of employment with the Group. The Group accounts for its liability for future gratuity 
benefits based on actuarial valuation determined at each Balance Sheet date by an Independent Actuary using Projected 
Unit Credit Method. The Group makes contributions to a Gratuity Fund administered by the Life Insurance Corporation 
of India.  
The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining 
the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan are based on the market yields on Government Securities 
as at the Balance Sheet date.     
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities 
involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. 
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net deﬁned 
beneﬁt liability), are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to other equity 
through OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassiﬁed to statement of proﬁt and loss in 
subsequent periods. 
3.19 
Share Based Payments 
The Group has formulated an Employees Stock Option Scheme to be administered through respective Trusts for its 
subsidiaries MML and MHFCL. The fair value of options granted under Employee Stock Option Plan is recognised as 
an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in other equity. The total amount to be expensed is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the options. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is 
the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the estimates 
of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting and service conditions are revised. It 
recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in Statement of Profit and Loss, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity. 
3.20 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the enterprise determines the level of provision by discounting 
the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific to the liability. The expense relating to any 
provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. 
3.21 
Assets held for sale 
Assets possessed against the settlement of loans are carried in the balance sheet at a value of outstanding principal loan 
amount or fair value of asset whichever is lower. In case the fair value of the asset acquired is lower than the outstanding 
principal loan amount; then the shortfall is to be provided for in the books of account in such financial year. 
These assets are classified as ‘Assets held for sale’ under ‘Non-financial assets’ till the asset acquired is finally disposed. 
The outstanding overdue interest and other charges will be accounted on realization basis.  
Further, if on disposal of the assets so acquired, the sale proceed is higher than the receivable amount (including 
outstanding loan, outstanding overdue interest, other charges and interest), then the Company will refund the excess 
amount to the borrowers.

3.22 
Taxes 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
3.21.1 Current Tax 
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of taxable profit for a period. Taxable profit differs from 
‘profit before tax’ as reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws.  
Interest income / expenses and penalties, if any, related to income tax are included in current tax expense. The tax rates 
and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of reporting date 
in India where the Group operates and generates taxable income. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either 
in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
3.22.2 Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is probable 
that future taxable amounts will arise to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax assets are reviewed 
at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities are realised 
simultaneously. 
3.22.3 Goods and services tax /value added taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses 
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the goods and services tax/value added taxes paid, except: 
i.
When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in
which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense
item, as applicable
ii.
When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included
The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the balance sheet. 
3.23 
Contingent Liabilities and assets 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present 
obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized 
because it cannot be measured reliably. The Group does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in 
the ﬁnancial statements. 
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be conﬁrmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity. The 
Group does not have any contingent assets in the ﬁnancial statements. 
F 213

3.24 
Earnings Per Share 
The Group reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic EPS 
is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting preference 
dividend and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity 
shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have been 
issued at a later date. In computing the dilutive earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that 
either reduces the earnings per share or increases loss per share are included. 
3.25 
Dividends on ordinary shares 
The Group recognises a liability to make distributions to equity holders of the Group when the distribution is authorised, 
and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is 
authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. 
3.26 
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement 
and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or 
assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
Transition to Ind AS 116 
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) through Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2019 
and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Second Amendment Rules, had notified Ind AS 116 Leases which 
replaced the existing lease standard, Ind AS 17 Leases, and other interpretations. Ind AS 116 set out the principles for 
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. It introduced a single, on-
balance sheet lease accounting model for leases. 
The Group has adopted Ind AS 116, effective annual reporting period beginning April 1, 2019, using modified 
retrospective approach and accordingly previous period information has not been reinstated.  
Group as a lessee 
The Groups lease asset class consists of building, equipment and vehicles. The Group assesses whether a contract contains 
a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group has, at the date of transition, recognized 
a right-of use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less (short term lease) and low value assets. For these short-term and low value leases, 
the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  
The right-of-use assets are recognized at cost, which comprises the present value of the lease liability as at the date of 
transition. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the balance lease term and useful 
life of the underlying asset. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future 
lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit on the lease or, if not readily 
determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates. Interest accrued on lease liability and lease payments made, are 
subsequently adjusted to the initial recognition of lease liability. 
On application of Ind AS 116, the nature of expenses has changed from lease rent in previous periods to depreciation cost 
for the right-to-use asset, and finance cost for interest accrued on lease liability. For leases that were classified as finance 
lease applying Ind AS 17, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of transition to 
Ind AS 116 is the carrying amount of the lease asset and the lease liability on the transition date as measured applying 
Ind AS 17. 
Group as a lessor 
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased 
items are operating leases. Rental Income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the 
lease terms and is included in rental income in the statement of profit and loss.

3.27 
Cash flow statement 
Cash flows are reported using indirect method, whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions 
of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments and items of income or 
expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from regular revenue generating (operating 
activities), investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. 
4. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the 
accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimates are revised, and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the 
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could 
result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. 
In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognized in the ﬁnancial statements is included in the 
following notes: 
4.1 
Business Model Assessment 
Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The 
Group determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to 
achieve a business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the 
performance of the assets is evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets 
and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Group monitors financial assets 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity 
to understand the reason for their disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for 
which the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Group’s continuous assessment of whether the business model for 
which the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has 
been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the classification of those assets. 
4.2 
Deﬁned employee beneﬁt assets and liabilities 
The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial 
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the 
future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly sensitive to changes 
in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
4.3 
Fair value measurement 
When the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based 
on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using various valuation techniques. The inputs to these 
models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required 
in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. 
Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of ﬁnancial instruments. 
4.4 
Impairment of financial assets 
The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement the estimation of the 
amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when determining impairment losses and the assessment of 
a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by several factors, changes in which can result in different 
levels of allowances. 
It has been the Group’s policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust when 
necessary.  
F 215

Muthoot FinCorp Limited 
Notes forming part of consolidated financial statements 
4.5 
Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method 
The Group’s EIR methodology, recognises interest income / expense using a rate of return that represents the best estimate 
of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of loans given / taken and recognises the effect of potentially 
different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments and 
penalty interest and charges). 
This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and lifecycle of the 
instruments, as well expected changes to India’s base rate and other fee income/expense that are integral parts of the 
instrument. 
4.6 
Lease Term 

The determination of lease term for some lease contracts in which the Company is a lessee, including whether the
Company is reasonably certain to exercise lessee options.

The determination of the incremental borrowing rate used to measure lease liabilities.
4.7 
Share based payments
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation 
model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most 
appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and 
making assumptions about them. 
4.8 
Other estimates 
These include contingent liabilities, useful lives of tangible and intangible assets etc.
